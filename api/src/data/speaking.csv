1.0,"Yeah. Well, there are thousands of things that a visitor can do in my hometown. As I live in a historical town, the visitor can go sightseeing. There are so many places that a visitor can enjoy taking his time there and spending his time there. And what are the common occupations of people there? Well, I guess the main occupation of our city is making some, how can I say, traditional stuff. And, you know, our city is famous for historical materials and stuff. Is it a good place for a child growing up there? Well, yeah, I guess it's a natural and good place for a child to spend his childhood there. And, yeah, it's a good place. Now, let's move on to talk about concentration. What activities help you to concentrate? Well, there are a few things that really help me to focus and concentrate on different things, especially studying. The first thing is probably drinking a bottle of water and trying to relax. I try to take a chill pill before getting started. And do you think having a routine helps you to concentrate better? Yeah, yeah. It's one of those most effective and efficient ways that someone can take into practice, can put into practice to help improve their concentration. Is it easy or difficult for you to concentrate? It's rather medium, somewhere between difficult and easy. OK, thank you very much. Now let's talk about fashion. Is fashion important to you? Not really much. Actually, I have never thought about it. It's a tricky question for me. But sometimes, I really care about it. For example, when I want to hang out with a special friend, I really care about how I'm going to look like. Do you think it's important to be updating your clothes and hair as fashion trends change? Well, yeah, it's important. But I really don't think about it that much. I try to spend a little bit of my time about it. What kinds of clothes do you like wearing? Well, I try to look fine in public. So it doesn't really matter for me what kind of clothes I'm going to wear.",164.0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZd79iNE6AI,"So, first, to start with your fluency and coherence, which is the first criteria, because, as you might know, there are four criteria in IELTS speaking based on which you will be evaluated. And the first one is your fluency and coherence. To talk about this one, I can say that the good thing in your speaking is that you are able to speak at length. Like, whatever question you are given, you just provide explanations and examples, and you have the flow of speech, which is really good in your speaking. You had some self-repetition, self-correction, not too many, which is good, and you should always know that you need to avoid hesitations or pauses. You didn't have many pauses because you were able to talk about the topic, but it is always a good idea to just maintain this flow of a speech and being fluent. So, generally, I can say that your topic development is good, and I recommend you to cover the two minutes in the second part, because this way, you can use more vocabulary, more grammatical structures, and you can show the examiner what you actually know in order to get a higher score. But you covered all the bullet points in the second part. Other than that, something else that you should take into account is that in part one, as you know, you shouldn't just give a very short answer, and you were aware of that. You knew that you should have provided explanations and examples, but the thing is that as you're just trying to stick to what you really think of the question, or what you really think of, like, whatever you're asked to talk about, sometimes you run out of ideas. Sometimes you don't know what else to say, and because of that, you give short explanations or you repeat the same idea. So I do recommend you to sometimes fake your answer. For example, in the first part, if you just fake some of your answers, or you just referred to a topic that you are better at or you have better collocations in, then you could give better ideas, right? Sometimes, to me, it felt like you didn't know what else to say. For example, I asked you three questions about concentration, and maybe you find some of these questions so similar, especially it happens a lot in the third part, so fake your answer. You can do as you want, because as long as you give a relevant answer to the question, then you're good to go. So because of all of that, which are very good things so far, you could get a very good score. The only problem you had in your fluency and coherence is that you did not use a wide range of connectives and discourse markers. This is necessary if you want to get a high score, because you were mostly using AND, SO, BUT, BECAUSE. You also used the word AS, but try to give a wider range to that, because you have the potential to do it. You can use them naturally. For example, ALTHOUGH, EVEN THOUGH, ON ONE HAND, ON THE OTHER HAND, BESIDES, MORE OVER, HOWEVER, AS, SINCE, you can use these words more flexibly. So, that's why you got a 6 in your fluency and coherence today. You can easily get a 7, and getting a higher score is a matter of time and practice, but you can do that. For now, today, your score is a 6 in your fluency and coherence. Now to talk about the next criteria, which is your lexical resource, your vocabulary. Your vocabulary is actually one of your strongest points, because you were able to use a range of collocations or vocabulary related to the topic. As I was changing the topics, you just used some related to each. For example, GO SIGHTSEEING, or MAKE A DECISION, you just said that it walks on my nerve, TO GET TO SOMEBODY, A COMMON SENSE, MAKE A CALL, MAKE AN APPOINTMENT. So, it is very important to use collocations and idiomatic language, and you were using some. Other than that, your paraphrasing was good, because, for example, instead of the word EFFECTIVE, you used the word EFFICIENT, or PURCHASE, or BUY, TO HAVE A TENDENCY, TO DO SOMETHING. So, always try to use direct synonyms, not only in your own sentences, but also to paraphrase the examiner's question. A simple example would be when I ask you, for example, DO YOU LIKE YOUR HOMETOWN? You say, YES, I DO LOVE WHERE I LIVE. So, try to just paraphrase the words that you can. Just the words that you are 100% sure about the direct, their direct synonyms, because being error-free is very, very much more important than using some words or structures that may be incorrect. So, because of all that, you got a 7 in your lexical resource, in your vocabulary. You just need to use more idiomatic language if you can, or more fillers and boosters, because they can help you buy some time, think of the next idea and then keep talking. For example, you say, THAT'S A VERY INTERESTING QUESTION, LET ME THINK ABOUT IT. And then you just talk about it. Now, in your grammatical range and accuracy, in your grammar, which is the next criteria, I can say that you were imperfect, like used to, future tenses, past perfect, this is really good. Other than that, you were using a range of complex structures, for example, conditional sentences, or relative clauses, subordinate clauses. But, if you use more connectives, you would be able to make more complex grammatical structures. So, try to do that, because it can positively impact your fluency and coherence, and also your grammatical range and accuracy at the same time. You just made a few mistakes, for example, you said, HOW I LOOK LIKE, HOW I LOOK. Or, WE GET THERE, WE GOT THERE. TAKE A LOT OF TIME, TAKE A LOT OF TIME. Some words were missing. Or, it happens to many candidates, the mistake with the tenses in the second part. For example, you should have talked about something in the past, when you were standing in a line, but you used present tenses a few times. So, be careful with the tenses in the second part, and not to miss a word in your sentences. So, because of all that, you got another 7 in your grammatical range and accuracy. If you want to get an 8, you don't have a problem with making mistakes. But, if you want to get an 8, you need to use more complex structures. And finally, in your pronunciation, you got another 7, because, first of all, your pronunciation and how you speak English is clear to understand. Sometimes you need to slow down, because if you slow down, you can refer to more ideas. Because you have so much on your mind, and you want to talk about all of that, and because of it, you make mistakes. You have self-repetition sometimes. Just slow down, and try to give a better intonation to your speaking if you can, instead of repeating some words, or just going back to what you had already mentioned. You had one mispronunciation, which was the word traditional. It's not traditional, traditional. And you can still work more on your intonation, like your word stress, your sentence stress, but generally you didn't have many mispronunciations, and you were good in this criteria as well. So, just to wrap up, you got a 6 in your fluency and coherence, a 7 in your vocabulary, your lexical resource, another 7 in your grammatical range and accuracy, and another 7 in your pronunciation, which would bring you an overall band score of 7.",491.0,6.5,6.0,7.0,7.0,0.4505494505494505,Describe an occasion when you were standing in a line or a queue. You should say: 1) When it was 2) Where you were 3) What you did when you waited in the queue and explain how you felt about it.,True,False,"Part 1 (student and teacher's dialogue): 
Yeah. Well, there are thousands of things that a visitor can do in my hometown. As I live in a historical town, the visitor can go sightseeing.

So it doesn't really matter for me what kind of clothes I'm going to wear.
Part 2 (student answering the 2nd part open question): 
Well, a few years ago, there was a toy that everyone wanted to have. And, at that time, I had a really strong tendency to buy this toy. And, one day, me and one of my friends, one of my friends and I, made the decision to go and purchase this product. So, we went to the downtown, and there was this long queue. And, we stayed in it. We got there and stayed in it. But, the problem was, it was just so long. And, everyone wanted to buy the toy. And, I told my friend, hey man, it's going to take a lot of time to stay there. But, he said, please be consistent. And, yeah. While we were there, we tried to do many things to amuse ourselves. For example, working out, working with my phone, talking to each other, and, you know, discussing different topics. And, it was a really good time. But, when I think about it right now, I think I really wasted my time on that toy. Because, you know, when I purchased it, it wasn't really amusing or entertaining for me. Because, it didn't have any specific or, how can I say, specific or nice features. So, I just tried to get rid of it. And, I sold it to my cousin. And, yeah. It was the entire story. Yeah. Just it. Do you want to add more information? No. That's fine.
Part 3 (student and teacher's dialogue): 
Is it very common in your country to have people standing in queues and waiting? In some occasions, and yeah, of course, for example, if you want to buy some dairy purchases, dairy products, groceries, some things we do have every day. Yeah, it's common. It's common and you need to stay in a queue. Okay, and how about the technology? Do you think that technology has played an impressive role to reduce waiting time? Yeah, of course. In the past few decades, it really has helped a lot because we used to stand in queues just for a taxi or bus. But we don't need to do that anymore and we can get a car right now, we can get a taxi by just using our phones. Okay, and... It's a lot more convenient. So, do you think that it has also been effective when you want to go to banks and supermarkets, or you still need to wait for a long time? Well, about supermarkets, no, I don't think so. Because there are a lot of groceries and supermarkets all over the country, all over the city, that anyone can access easily to these shops and purchase their availing products. Okay, and how about yourself? How do you feel when someone breaks the line impatiently? It really works on my nerves when someone does that. And when I try to control myself, and I just get to that person and alarm them and, hey, man, you got to be more careful because there are a lot of people standing here, just to take one of these. So that's all I would do in this situation. Okay, and what do you think the reaction of other people would be to that? Well, I guess they will support me because, I mean, it's common sense that you need to fight for your rights. Okay. And do you think customer service helplines make you wait for a long time? No, I don't think so about that because, I mean, they are much more inconvenient and it doesn't take much time. Why do you think so? Can you explain more about that? Yeah, of course. You know, customer services uses some methods for reducing the queue. For example, if you want to use some services that a company provides, you need to make an appointment with this company, okay? So, I mean, there is no such thing in this case. There is no such thing as queue in this method because you just make a call, you make your appointment, and you will get there on time. Okay. Yeah.

If you want to get an 8, you don't have a problem with making mistakes. But, if you want to get an 8, you need to use more complex structures. And finally, in your pronunciation, you got another 7, because, first of all, your pronunciation and how you speak English is clear to understand. Sometimes you need to slow down, because if you slow down, you can refer to more ideas. Because you have so much on your mind, and you want to talk about all of that, and because of it, you make mistakes. You have self-repetition sometimes. Just slow down, and try to give a better intonation to your speaking if you can, instead of repeating some words, or just going back to what you had already mentioned. You had one mispronunciation, which was the word traditional. It's not traditional, traditional. And you can still work more on your intonation, like your word stress, your sentence stress, but generally you didn't have many mispronunciations, and you were good in this criteria as well. So, just to wrap up, you got a 6 in your fluency and coherence, a 7 in your vocabulary, your lexical resource, another 7 in your grammatical range and accuracy, and another 7 in your pronunciation, which would bring you an overall band score of 7.",491.0,6.5,6.0,7.0,7.0,0.4164759725400457,Describe an occasion when you were standing in a line or a queue.

1.0,"I usually, I usually visit my family two or three times a week. I have a three-year-old daughter, but I really need to see my family regularly in a week. Do you want to live with your family in the future? Absolutely, yes. I hope, I hope that it's be true. Are you close to all of your family members? Particularly I'm really close to my parents, but I like my siblings, too. Okay, thank you very much. Now we can move on to the next topic. Let's talk about school activity. Did you have many activities to do in your school? Unfortunately, I'm not student, but I have been studying on myself, by myself in home. I've been working, but I used to many activities when I was student at university or college. Can you mention a cherished school activity that you have really enjoyed? Yes, yes, I remember that. If you ask me, I remember that. Many activities like playing various kinds of sports in school, like zoo, like volleyball and other sports that I really like to do. What kind of extracurricular activities do schools offer in your country for a student? For students in my country... Sorry, can I repeat the last question, please? Yes, I can repeat the question. What kind of extracurricular activities do schools offer in your country for a student? For students... Unfortunately, nowadays in my country, the resources are very low and many people have very low income. And the price of private school is very high, but it's very different between private school and public school. Thank you very much. Now let's move on to talk about memory. Do you have a good memory? I think I'm not. No, I haven't. Very good memory, unfortunately, but I try and I study a lot to improve my memory. How easy is it to improve one's memory? In my opinion, it's a need to practice every day and memorize every useful subject and read stories. And do you have an unforgettable childhood memory? Yes, sure, but bear with me while I think. I never think about that before. Yes, when we go on a trip with my family in summer season and we played. And I and my brother played a lot of water activities.",266.0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5L7qOCDF3OA,"Okay, so, now let's get started with the feedback part. As you may know, there are four criteria in iOS speaking, based on which your performance will be evaluated. And the first one is your fluency and coherence. Let's get started with that. In your fluency and coherence, I can say that, ummm... you are able to talk. And the good thing is that whenever you run out of ideas, you know how to use fillers and boosters, to just buy yourself some time, in order to maintain your flow of speech. However, the thing is that you need to work on your pauses, because you have so many hesitations, so many pauses. And when you have many pauses, you cannot maintain a good rhythm. So, you should avoid these pauses, or self-repetition, or self-correction. Like you say something, and then you just correct yourself, you just go back, you don't finish one sentence, in order to start the next sentence. So, you should avoid your hesitations, your self-repetition and self-correction, by working a bit on your grammar. Because the thing is that you are not sure about what structure to use, or what vocabulary to use. Like, you are using some structures, some phrases, or some words, that you use, but you are not 100% sure about them. Like, it can be... I can see it. I can feel it that you use it, but maybe in your mind you are thinking about the other words, or correct form of it. So, just try to use whatever you are 100% sure about, or try to practice and work more on your grammar, or on your vocabulary, so that you can use them correctly. And this can help you with your pauses, and also whenever you feel like you don't know what to say, or you run out of ideas, which is totally normal, you can fake your answer. I mean, you can lie. For example, you are talking about an art gallery that you attended. Maybe you can just talk about it for one sentence, if it's part one or three. In that case, if you need to explain more, then you can just talk, not only about your experience, but about something that you saw on TV. Some information that you have about it, you can just fake your answer. Or you talk about somebody else's experience as your experience, right? You can fake your answer, because nobody knows what's going on in your mind. So you can lie. But as long as your answer is related to the question, you are good to go. Other than that, regarding your fluency and coherence, you need to use more connectives and discourse markers, especially the connectives. Because if you just use and, so, but, because, you cannot get a high score. So instead, try to use some better alternatives for those words. For example, instead of and, you can use in addition, moreover, besides. Or instead of but, you can use however. Instead of because, you can use as or since, or many other connectives that you can use. But just use the ones that you are able to apply correctly, the ones that you can use naturally. Because if you sound like you have memorized some words or sentences, then it will mark you down. And your topic development is good. You had problems with the definition of some words. For example, laborious jobs, labor, when it includes... When it includes. But the good thing is that you didn't stop, you didn't say, I don't know, and you gave an answer. That's really good. That's brilliant. Because this way, maybe your answer is correct, right? Okay, because of all the things I mentioned, you got a five today in your fluency and coherence. And now to move on to your lexical resource, which is your vocabulary, the next criteria. In your vocabulary, you were able to talk about different topics, as I mentioned before, even the topics that you had no idea what to say about. But your vocabulary range was very limited, or the ones you used were not all correct. For example, you said humiliate. Maybe you wanted to say humble, a humble person. Or low-income people. For example, you say it's a low-income job. Or meet the ends meet, I guess you said, to make the ends meet. So just use the words or structures that you are sure about. First, try to be error-free. Then add more vocabulary and collocations to your speaking. And other than that, a better paraphrasing is what you need. Because when the examiner asks you a question, this is really good that you use fillers and boosters to buy yourself some time and then develop the topic. But the thing is that you can still paraphrase better. Like I say, for example, do you enjoy going out with your friends? You can say, I have a great time hanging out with my friends. Or I do love spending time with my friends. So you can use direct synonyms to paraphrase the examiner's question or your own sentences. This is about your vocabulary and now your grammar. I can say your grammar has had some negative impacts on the other criteria as well. Because you made so many minor grammatical mistakes. For example, you were using very good tenses, like present perfect continuous, used to, or future tenses, present continuous. But you were not using them all correctly. For example, you said I used to school activity. I used to do, or I used to engage in a verb you need here. So if you're using a range of tenses which is very good, try to use them correctly. Or other mistakes, like you said, no I'm not. But you should have said, no I don't, the answer to one of the questions. Or one of my friend, which was one of my friends, many problem, many problems. One of our experience, one of our experiences. Or for many times, no, for a long time. So be very careful with your mistakes. Because you were almost making mistakes in all your sentences. Even if you were using some complex structures, like conditional sentences or subordinate clauses. Just like your vocabulary. First try to be error free, then add a better variety of words or structures to that. So because of all the things I mentioned, in your vocabulary and in your grammar, you got five, you got a five. Just like your fluency and coherence. And finally in your pronunciation. In this criteria, I can say that your pace of the speech is fine. You're not speaking very fast or very slowly. But you had some mispronunciations. And because of the pauses, you couldn't maintain a good rhythm, a good intonation. You need to raise and lower your voice. You shouldn't sound flat when you're speaking to the examiner. And your speaking was a bit flat. So just to talk about your mispronunciations. For example the word particularly, adventure, activity. Your word stress was not right. Or advanced, aggressive, right? So be very careful with how you pronounce the words. When you avoid the pauses or when you reduce your pauses, you can have a better pronunciation and give a better intonation to your speaking. You can do that by working on your listening every day. It's not something you can do in a week or in a few days. Work on your listening every day. It can be 15 minutes a day. But try to watch movies. Try to listen to anything in English. If you don't have the chance to talk to native speakers, then try to watch movies or listen to music. Or you'd better listen to English podcasts. And repeat after some sentences. Because this shadowing technique can help you a lot with your intonation. So you got another 5 in your pronunciation. And now to wrap up. You got a 5 in your fluency and coherence. You need to use more connectives, reduce your pauses, and use more complex structures. Because it would sound more fluent when you use more structures. In your vocabulary, you got another 5. Try to use more words correctly. And then paraphrase better. In your grammar, this is an area that you should really work on. Because this is something related to your own language. If you work on it, you can really mark up. And finally, in your pronunciation, you got another 5. Try to keep working on it every day. Your intonation and your pronunciation. So your overall band score today would be a 5. Now if you have any questions or doubts, then you can ask me.",553.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,0.6909090909090909,"Describe an energetic person you know.

But you had some mispronunciations. And because of the pauses, you couldn't maintain a good rhythm, a good intonation. You need to raise and lower your voice. You shouldn't sound flat when you're speaking to the examiner. And your speaking was a bit flat. So just to talk about your mispronunciations. For example the word particularly, adventure, activity. Your word stress was not right. Or advanced, aggressive, right? So be very careful with how you pronounce the words. When you avoid the pauses or when you reduce your pauses, you can have a better pronunciation and give a better intonation to your speaking. You can do that by working on your listening every day. It's not something you can do in a week or in a few days. Work on your listening every day. It can be 15 minutes a day. But try to watch movies. Try to listen to anything in English. If you don't have the chance to talk to native speakers, then try to watch movies or listen to music. Or you'd better listen to English podcasts. And repeat after some sentences. Because this shadowing technique can help you a lot with your intonation. So you got another 5 in your pronunciation. And now to wrap up. You got a 5 in your fluency and coherence. You need to use more connectives, reduce your pauses, and use more complex structures. Because it would sound more fluent when you use more structures. In your vocabulary, you got another 5. Try to use more words correctly. And then paraphrase better. In your grammar, this is an area that you should really work on. Because this is something related to your own language. If you work on it, you can really mark up. And finally, in your pronunciation, you got another 5. Try to keep working on it every day. Your intonation and your pronunciation. So your overall band score today would be a 5. Now if you have any questions or doubts, then you can ask me.",553.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,0.7424892703862661,"Describe an energetic person you know.

And how do people in your country meet others and make friends? In my country, the majority of people like tourists. So, when they're meeting each other, you know, they're kind of interested in them. So, they're just meeting. And do adults and children make friends in the same way? I think, no. The children are making lots of friends than adults, because, you know, the communication way is more easier for them and they have no special things... special... Now, let's move on to talk about laughter. Do you usually make your friends laugh? Oh, yeah, actually, I do it a lot. They call me sometimes, you're doing so much, you're kind of a clown. But I'm also fending off that word. I'm trying to be not approachable for them as a clown. So, they say that. And in what situations do people laugh? I think they're laughing to things that they don't have the courage to do it. For example, especially in public places. When I'm doing something that it's illegal and they can't do it, they make them laugh. And do you think it's important for friends to have the same sense of humor? Oh, yeah, yeah, it's very important. When we're friends, the sense of humor is very essential. And, for example, if we don't laugh together, it means that we can't be friends. Now, let's move on to talk about time management. How do you organize your time? Oh, that's interesting question. I'm an organized person. I always organize my time. I'm scheduling the things. And even in trips, I'm making an itinerary. And I'm always doing the things. First of all, I'm putting the important things, the entertainment first. Then, the things that are essential second. Perfect. Now, do you think people organize time in the same way? No, I don't think that. Some people are organized people, but some people are not organized. They're just doing the things randomly. They don't have plan to do it. And how do you feel when you are late for an appointment? Oh, that's a very terrible thing to happen to me. And I always try to be on time and do the things exactly to settle time. And I feel very bad about it. All right.",184.0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAM9iLnCKx8,"We reviewed your performance based on four criteria, as you know them. Fluency and coherence, lexical resource, grammatical range and accuracy, and pronunciation. These are the four criteria based on which we assess your performance. So, let's go to fluency and coherence. You were fluent, you spoke at length, without any noticeable effort. You kept on going and you could be easily followed. You were coherent, that's what matters. But the only thing you have to do is to use a wider range of connectives and link the sentences using a wider range of connectives like although, however, in the meantime, meanwhile, all those a little bit better and more beautiful connectives in order to sound more natural. But in general, you were highly capable of giving and producing long answers to the questions. This is what matters. When it comes to vocabulary, lexical resource, this is one of your strongest points. You used a variety of vocabulary, a variety of beautiful words to describe the situation and you really caught my eye. You were amazing. You used the itinerary, you said ironic, you used collocations like the majority of people or in the vicinity of or health issues. And all of those collocations are perfect and are placed in the right situation. This is what makes your band score rises. So, this is with regards to vocabulary. Of course, you've got a couple of misplaced words or for example, you said health body instead of healthy body and then you corrected it in the third time that you used the same combination. And once you said confident instead of confidence. Yes, and these are minor mistakes that can easily be fixed by more practice and by better attention to the details. So, then with regards to the grammar, grammatical range and accuracy, I really didn't notice any mistake grammatically speaking except for more easier. It's easier. You don't need to add more to it and I know that you know but you were stressed out in the beginning that happened in the first part of the exam. It's okay. But you were using the complex structures strongly and accurately and you could speak at length and when you elaborate on your responses, you did not face any problem. Some people face problem in using compound sentences but you did use complex sentences with a high capability and efficiently. And that's what matters. Good job. And in terms of pronunciation, you don't have really any problem with pronunciation. You sounded naturally. You, of course, cared for the rise and fall and the rhythm and the music while speaking. I could get some of the messages through your emotions and there are some emotions in your sentences. That's because you really mean what you say and you apply this music and rhythm and intonation. Good job. You had just one mispronunciation and that's the word exercise that you pronounced it as exercise. That's a very minor problem. You need to fix it. In terms of vocabulary, of course, you did have a wide range of vocabulary. It's okay. But pay attention to the part of speech. So, for example, if you want to use the noun, you have to use the noun form of the word. I'm talking about the word confident. So, you said confidence, but it was a noun. You should have said confidence. If you pay attention to the part of speech, you would definitely increase your band score easily. Technically, yes. If you fix those problems, and especially if you use boosters like you did once in the fluency part, I have jotted down that's a terrible thing to happen for a person. I consider it as a booster. I consider it a booster because it gives you time and energy to talk about the issue. So, when you say it, you buy yourself some time to find the idea. And you did have some hesitations, but those hesitations were content-related. You were not searching for words. You were searching for ideas in order to answer the question. So, use boosters like that's a terrible question, or that's a hard question. That's a terrible thing to happen for a person. Or, oh my goodness, that's a situation which is terrible to happen to anybody. So, when you use those boosters, and even some fillers, speech fillers. When you use speech fillers like sort of, yeah, or like, sort of, you know, when you use those fillers, you buy yourself some time to speak fluently and find the ideas. When you find the ideas, you can confidently and easily speak and express your ideas and speak out your thoughts.

Part 2 (student answering the 2nd part open question): 
Okay, I remember one time in high school grade, we went to the gym with my friend. One of my friends, his name was Zabbar, and we had a very good exercise. And that was the first one month I was starting, I was started exercising. Then I, we finished the exercise. Then, I take the figures and he take me pictures. I was very totally, very skinny person at that time, but I thought that I'm great. So, I really, the poses on that picture, I remember that, because the confident was obvious from my faces, from my pictures. But, these exercises, I think, the things that I did in this, at that time, it was useless. The exercises I supposed to do was useless to my body, and I didn't know anything about bodybuilding, but I thought I know everything about it. So, I think, that was a waste of time. And when I'm looking back to my pictures, when I'm looking back at that time, I think, I'm, I kind of feel shy and less confident. So, I'm learning a lot of things at that time, till now, when we're knowing anything about something, we think that we know everything about it. But, the more we know the things, the more we understand that we know anything. And I think it's the point of these exercises and the memory that I had with my friend. And I remember, even though one of the exercises we did inside is called the ping pong. And that was with my another friend, named Gassemi. And that's kind of very ironic exercise, as far as I remember.
Part 3 (student and teacher's dialogue): 
What types of fitness centers are popular in your country these days? What I think about them, but in past time, if we look to past time, it wasn't like this. And are there any negative effects of exercising in gyms? Yes, there are negative effects. There are some exaggeratings, as you know, in every field, even in exercising. So, people are, people using, people using too much supplements and it's harmful for their body like creatinine. It's very harmful for their body and their kidney. So, they're exaggerating of using this and sometimes they are doing the things wrong at gym. And there is no codes to consider them. And do you think exercise and good health is being given more importance in society now? And why? Yes, actually it has. In society, when the people all works out, the people all have a health body and health brain, it means that less drugs, cells, less negative persons and the whole society is kind of healthy people. It's obviously a good effect to all the society. And how do you, how do young people in your country feel about fitness? About fitness? They just think it's showing up. They just think that they should pop up their body and just show it to people and it's not all about this. It's a health issue. It's more than this. That's what I think. And do you think gyms can introduce more fitness-related programs than just exercising on machines? I'm sorry, could you please repeat the question? All right, I'll go again. Do you think gyms can introduce more fitness-related programs than just exercising on machines? Exercising on machines. Yes, they do. They can more create these things more like recreation. They can make the things related to recreation and people can have habits and exercising at the same time. And that's a very bright idea. I think if some rich person can think about it, he can make a very good recreation, accomplishment and fitness system in the same area. And that's very important and I think very efficient. Can you elaborate on it more? Oh, yeah, sure. For example, if they do exercise with what? Actually, I have no idea what. But I think about the general idea and I have nothing special in my mind now for this matter. But I think a lot about it. I can find something and I can present it to the rich people. That's an idea.

First of all, I do recommend you to reduce your hesitations because sometimes you are speaking so slowly, pausing for a long time to think of what you actually want to say. So, maybe in the beginning of your boosters only to buy yourself some time, analyze what you want to say, and then you can start talking. You've used a few fillers, like, for example, as I remember, like boosters and fillers, but maybe you can use more of that just to reduce your hesitations. Other than that, you had some self-repetition, like you set something and then you repeated the vocabulary in your speaking. So, instead, maybe you can use some other words, some other structures to talk about newer ideas, not to repeat yourself. And if you want to get a higher score in fluency and coherence, try to use more connectives and discourse markers. Because if you only use and, so, but, because, then that wouldn't be enough. You use the same thing, discourse markers, but the thing is that maybe you could use more of them. For example, however, besides, in addition, on one hand, on the other hand, throughout the test, part one, part two, and part three, wherever you think is the correct place to use it. The last thing I should mention regarding your fluency and coherence is that make sure to cover your ideas and give the relevant answer to the question. For example, in the first part where I was asking you about the handwriting, the first question and the third question, your answer was not really related. Like, for example, in the third one I asked you about the impression that you can make on other people with your handwriting and you gave me an answer, but it had nothing to do with the question itself. So, listen carefully to the question. If you don't understand the question, then you can ask the examiner to repeat the question. No problem with that. And then make sure you're giving the relevant answer to that. So, that's all about your fluency and coherence. Now to talk about your lexical resource, your vocabulary. In your vocabulary, I can say the good thing was that you were able to talk about all these familiar or unfamiliar topics to you. Maybe some of them were a bit harder for you to understand or just elaborate on, some of them were easier. But anyways, you kept talking, especially in the second part. You just kept talking for the two minutes and you talked about all the bullet points here and that's a very good thing. However, I do recommend you to use a wider range of vocabulary. For example, in the first part you use the connotations making habits, making a habit. That was a really good one and I really expected to hear more of these words, some more collocations like the combination of words together which give you a new meaning. For example, I don't know about eating, you can say to eat in moderation. That's a good collocation about eating. So, if you can use more vocabulary, more collocations or even EDMs, then you can really boost your scoring in this part. You used, as I mentioned before, you used a few fillers and boosters but maybe you could use more just to buy yourself some time. And don't forget paraphrasing. Paraphrase the examiners question. Don't repeat the exact same words. Try to use some synonyms to paraphrase the question. For example, I say, do you like watching TV? You can say, I'm a big fan of watching TV. So, this is all about paraphrasing. Using the direct synonyms to paraphrase the question or to paraphrase your own sentences. Now, to talk about your grammatical range and accuracy. I can say that you can boost your score in this one really easily if you get some practice because you are familiar with many structures, with different tenses but the thing is that you make several mistakes, frequent mistakes while you are using them. And your mistakes were... your mistakes just increased as you were going on with the different parts. Like in part one, you had less grammatical mistakes but in part two and especially part three, almost in all your sentences, you were making mistakes and maybe it was because you try to be more careful with the mistakes you make. For example, you said too many time which is too much time. It was mostly singular, plural and tenses. It has the people is losing which was people are losing that was actually a pronunciation problem. See a sports, to make a mistake. No, make a mistake. It depends of, it depends on or I used watch, I used to watch. You want to talk about your past habit. Use to watch. And don't forget the subject. Maybe in your mother tongue or some other languages you speak, you are, it is okay not to use the subject and just use the verb right there but in English, you don't, you shouldn't forget that. You shouldn't miss the subject. Okay? And so this is all about your grammar and be careful with the tenses, especially in the second part because maybe the first bullet point is in present but the next one is in past. So you were not using the tenses correctly, especially in the second part. Finally, your pronunciation. In your pronunciation, it was, it was clear to understand what you were saying but you were not using the pronunciation features really well. I mean, you had several mispronunciations or more importantly, your intonation was not really good in this, in the three parts. It was a bit flat while you were talking to me. So maybe you can just raise and lower your voice in a way that it's more like, you know, English intonation. And about your mispronunciations, for example, instead of I quit my job, you said I quite my job. Or study, which is study. And club, which is club. Specially, you said specially. Physical, again physical. So the sound Z that you pronounce it Z and Z usually, that you could hear, like it was not pure English. So make sure to use the English word with the English pronunciation, ok? Ok.",464.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,0.7302631578947368,"Describe a live sport match that you have watched.

I think the handwriting, it's important to make, like, the brain work. And also in the computers, because we are in the technology. Is it still necessary to keep handwriting? Yes, because I think when the children are growing, it's the first steps to learn the language and also to make, like, synopsis, cerebral synopsis in their brain. What impression does a person's handwriting have on other people? Umm... I think the people is losing the importance of handwriting. Because in this time we have a lot of cell phones and computers.

To be honest, I don't see a sport. Ummm... But, if I need to explain one game, I remember when the Copa America is playing with Brazil and Argentina. Ummm...

And do you think it's beneficial to give children who work hard in school prizes? Sorry? I can repeat my question. Is it beneficial to give children who work hard in school prizes? Yes, I think it's good, but it depends on the children. Because sometimes they can feel, like, strong, more strong than they are. What do you mean by strong? I mean, like, when the children have, like, too much energy and that energy can use in bad things, like... Okay, and what kinds of sports competitions do people watch in your country? In my country, Mexico, it's football. All the people like football. I think it's the most seen sports here. And why do you think people watch football more than the other sports? Not sure. It's too many time seen that sport, like, 50 years ago. But I think actually we see also baseball, because Mexicans are improving last years in the baseball. Do people normally prefer to watch live sports or watch them on TV? I think live sports. Why? Because it's in the moment and it's, like, the emotions to be the first and see the play. And are there any disadvantages to watching the live sports? Can you repeat the question, please? Are there any disadvantages to watching live sports? I don't think so. I think it's better because improve the economy, because the people go to the clubs and waste their money.

I don't know, maybe it's so bad, I don't know why, maybe it's because I feel, I don't know, English like once, but I don't know. It's something that you understand, but when you want to talk and you want to speak English, maybe it's harder. Yes, it's so harder because a lot of words forgive, I don't know. You forget all the words, your mind goes blank. Aha, my mind is blank, the structure, go. I see, you just need more practice. So, first I want to give you the feedback based on the different criteria and then we can talk about your overall hand score, okay? Okay. So, first of all, to talk about your fluency and coherence, the first criteria. I can say that what I love generally, your performance is that you are so energetic, you have self-confidence and you are able to keep talking, I mean, even if it is hard for you to produce a language and use the structures and use the words, but you have very good ideas to develop. It clearly shows that if you practice a bit and work on your English and strategies, you can get better the next time and in the future. So, about your fluency and coherence, as I told you, you were able to maintain the flow of the speech, you were able to talk, even in part two you ran out of ideas, but you just kept talking until the two minutes were over. However, you had some self-correction, is that something that you corrected yourself? You were not sure about the English form of the words or the structure in English because you are not actually thinking in English. You are thinking in your mother tongue, whatever it is. You said you are from Mexico so you speak Spanish. You were at times thinking in Spanish and not English and that is why you were just using some structures that were not actually correct in English. That led to self-correction, self-repetition and some hesitations, pauses when you were talking to me. I would recommend you to use more connectives as well and discourse markers. I mean, when you want to give me the answer, you can say, for example, well, actually, I think, in my opinion, or some fillers and boosters, to be honest, that is a very interesting question. Or connectives, for example, you were just using and, so, but, because. Just use more because if you only use these connectives, you cannot expect to get more than five in fluency and coherence. So you can use, for example, in addition to that, besides, however, even though, despite, something, unless, so use these words. That's about your fluency and coherence. In part one, you had more hesitations, but in the other parts, you had less hesitations, but generally you should work on thinking in English and widening your vocabulary range. Now to talk about the next criteria, your lexical resource, your vocabulary. In your vocabulary, I can say that you were able to talk about the unfamiliar and familiar topics. And I could hear some words, which were on point, for example, the financial education, the investment, Haribel or terrible, so that was a synonym. The scorpion, you knew some animal names. But I could not see a wide range. There was, how you were using the words was not used flexibly. And sometimes you didn't know the vocabulary in English and you were searching for words and you were speaking. I recommend you to widen your vocabulary and use some collocations, some idiomatic vocabulary and paraphrase better. Paraphrase means the use of synonyms. If I say something, don't repeat my words, use some direct synonyms. And now to move on to the third criteria. In the third criteria, your grammatical range and accuracy. I believe this is what you should work on more than the other criteria, your grammar, because whatever you were saying, it was clear to understand. I could get your point, but you were already making mistakes in most of your sentences, majority of your sentences. It was mostly about tenses. It was in present. First category is in present sometimes. Or prepositions, articles like the, a, an. And singular and plural. For example, I don't know, people. You were not sure is it singular or plural. And so much places, which is so many places. It's about singular and plural. And countable and uncountable. So I'm a degree, I have a degree. Or because COVID, because of COVID. Because it's always in tense. So that's about your grammar. Maybe you can just improve your grammar a bit and make less mistakes. If you want to get higher score, use more complex grammatical structures. Yours were all simple. And the last criteria, your pronunciation. To talk about your pronunciation, you, I mean, I can generally say that your pace of speech was good. It was not too slow or too fast. And you were trying to use some pronunciation features. You were clear to understand. But sometimes you have, at times you had some intonation problems. How you raise and lower your voice. And lapses in how you pronounce the words. For example, combination. You pronounce it as if it was some other word. But it was the word combination of two things. So try to pronounce the words the way they are pronounced in English. Because at times the intonation and the rhythm was not English. And for that you can listen to some native speakers. Talk to native speakers and try to apply a shadowing technique. Repeat after them the way they do. This can help your pronunciation.",389.0,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,0.6521739130434783,"Describe a home that you visited but did not want to live in.

Okay, two years ago I visited my aunt's house in the beach. It's in the state of Nayarit. It's not far away from Alhara, maybe five or six hours. The beach is a wonderful... After the 5 p.m. there's mosquitos, so little, little, little, little. And the weather is so hot. It's, I don't know what to say, but it's horrible. It's terrible, it's bad. In the house, in the home of my aunt, the weather is too hot. More than the beach. Have scorpions. The conditioner doesn't work, doesn't work. I don't know why, but... The only reason because me go to the house, my aunt's house, is because it's the beach. But it's terrible, it's terrible, it's hot, it's... They don't have internet, they don't have internet, they don't have... anything. They don't have a supermarket. Okay, the food is very good, the food is very good, and the beer is very good, it's cold. Thank you.
Part 3 (student and teacher's dialogue): 
Do people in your country like to visit other people's homes? Yes. Yes, because it's... it's cultural, it's funny, and it's the security... I don't know what you say, but it's funny. Okay, and how about you, how often do you visit other people? Maybe... two weeks, see? Two weeks or maybe one... twice to a month. No more than that. Okay, and in your country, when people visit each other, what do they normally do together? Okay, play game boards or drink some alcohol, maybe beers or tequila or... or whatever, water. Why do you think people do these activities when they gather together? Why do you think people do these activities, like drinking, playing games, why these? Only because it's funny. It's funny, it's a time to distract... distract or... I don't know what to say. Distract the week in the works, to start relax. It's funny. Okay, and how about the gifts? Are gifts necessary when visiting others in your culture? Yes, no gifts, but... gifts, sorry, but just maybe food or some... something to give to others, para... give to others. I don't know what you say, could be weird, but it's to the party and... Perfect, great, great. And now let's talk about the places that people like to live in your country. So can you tell me a bit about that? What kind of places, what kind of houses do people in your country would like to live in? In general the houses are small, maybe three rooms or one bedroom, one bathroom, but the people is nice. It's nice, but my favorite houses is in the beach. In the beach are... the houses are small too, and I don't know, it's calid... I don't know what to say, hot, but it's not hot, it's calid, it's nice, it's polite, the people is polite. In the houses... in the houses is polite. Ok, so now that you talked about living in the city and living maybe near the beach, let me ask you this question. What are the differences between the homes in the city and those in the suburbs? In the suburbs, especially in Guadalajara or Mexico City, all day have a much traffic and the people are fast all day. It's a stress sometimes. But it's so fun in the suburbs because we have all... not so much places to go. In the beach, no, only go to the beach, but it's relaxing, the beaches are funny and wonderful, beautiful.

I don't know, maybe it's so bad, I don't know why, maybe it's because I feel, I don't know, English like once, but I don't know. It's something that you understand, but when you want to talk and you want to speak English, maybe it's harder. Yes, it's so harder because a lot of words forgive, I don't know. You forget all the words, your mind goes blank. Aha, my mind is blank, the structure, go. I see, you just need more practice. So, first I want to give you the feedback based on the different criteria and then we can talk about your overall hand score, okay? Okay. So, first of all, to talk about your fluency and coherence, the first criteria. I can say that what I love generally, your performance is that you are so energetic, you have self-confidence and you are able to keep talking, I mean, even if it is hard for you to produce a language and use the structures and use the words, but you have very good ideas to develop. It clearly shows that if you practice a bit and work on your English and strategies, you can get better the next time and in the future. So, about your fluency and coherence, as I told you, you were able to maintain the flow of the speech, you were able to talk, even in part two you ran out of ideas, but you just kept talking until the two minutes were over. However, you had some self-correction, is that something that you corrected yourself? You were not sure about the English form of the words or the structure in English because you are not actually thinking in English. You are thinking in your mother tongue, whatever it is. You said you are from Mexico so you speak Spanish. You were at times thinking in Spanish and not English and that is why you were just using some structures that were not actually correct in English. That led to self-correction, self-repetition and some hesitations, pauses when you were talking to me. I would recommend you to use more connectives as well and discourse markers. I mean, when you want to give me the answer, you can say, for example, well, actually, I think, in my opinion, or some fillers and boosters, to be honest, that is a very interesting question. Or connectives, for example, you were just using and, so, but, because. Just use more because if you only use these connectives, you cannot expect to get more than five in fluency and coherence. So you can use, for example, in addition to that, besides, however, even though, despite, something, unless, so use these words. That's about your fluency and coherence. In part one, you had more hesitations, but in the other parts, you had less hesitations, but generally you should work on thinking in English and widening your vocabulary range. Now to talk about the next criteria, your lexical resource, your vocabulary. In your vocabulary, I can say that you were able to talk about the unfamiliar and familiar topics. And I could hear some words, which were on point, for example, the financial education, the investment, Haribel or terrible, so that was a synonym. The scorpion, you knew some animal names. But I could not see a wide range. There was, how you were using the words was not used flexibly. And sometimes you didn't know the vocabulary in English and you were searching for words and you were speaking. I recommend you to widen your vocabulary and use some collocations, some idiomatic vocabulary and paraphrase better. Paraphrase means the use of synonyms. If I say something, don't repeat my words, use some direct synonyms. And now to move on to the third criteria. In the third criteria, your grammatical range and accuracy. I believe this is what you should work on more than the other criteria, your grammar, because whatever you were saying, it was clear to understand. I could get your point, but you were already making mistakes in most of your sentences, majority of your sentences. It was mostly about tenses. It was in present. First category is in present sometimes. Or prepositions, articles like the, a, an. And singular and plural. For example, I don't know, people. You were not sure is it singular or plural. And so much places, which is so many places. It's about singular and plural. And countable and uncountable. So I'm a degree, I have a degree. Or because COVID, because of COVID. Because it's always in tense. So that's about your grammar. Maybe you can just improve your grammar a bit and make less mistakes. If you want to get higher score, use more complex grammatical structures. Yours were all simple. And the last criteria, your pronunciation. To talk about your pronunciation, you, I mean, I can generally say that your pace of speech was good. It was not too slow or too fast. And you were trying to use some pronunciation features. You were clear to understand. But sometimes you have, at times you had some intonation problems. How you raise and lower your voice. And lapses in how you pronounce the words. For example, combination. You pronounce it as if it was some other word. But it was the word combination of two things. So try to pronounce the words the way they are pronounced in English. Because at times the intonation and the rhythm was not English. And for that you can listen to some native speakers. Talk to native speakers and try to apply a shadowing technique.

So, Iran is my home town, and Tehran is my city, where I was born, and this is the city that my parents live, my family live, and I live too, but, umm, maybe about ten years ago, there was a chance for me to get out of Iran. Okay, and do you live in a house now, or a flat? No, it's not very small and not very big flat that I bought it maybe a year ago. Okay, and what would you change about your home? Actually, it was a long time that I was, I have decided to change the design of my house, my home. So, I did it maybe about one month ago. I changed the design totally. I changed the garden, the furniture, and the colour of the walls, and the kitchen as well. So, it was my decision to do it, and I did it. Nice, okay. Now, let's move on to talk about hobbies. Do you have a hobby? Of course. Anyone, I think anyone has a hobby, because if we don't have a hobby, we get bored. So, we cannot enjoy the life, we cannot enjoy the time, and definitely we will waste the time and we get bored. So, I have a hobby like others, and most important hobby that I have is going out and catching up with friends. Having dinner outside, going to see my friends, and spending time with them. Okay, and do you think hobbies should be shared with other people? In my opinion, I think no, because I'm a close person, so I don't have many friends. So, I prefer to have just one close friend or two, and share my hobby only with them. So, this is my character. I don't say anyone has to be like me. This is me and how I am. Great, and did you have a hobby as a child? Yes, when I was a child, I was about like seven years old. I really wanted to sing. I was crazy about singing and started learning from my father, because my father also used to sing. So, I got the tricks about singing from my father, and I continued when I was like 18 years old. I started working with a group that they were singing in Iran. They called the Aryan. So, I used to be their local team, in their local team. Right. Now, let's talk about the internet. How often do you go online? Good question, because I think I am online every single minute, because my work is online, and I answer to my client and customer through the WhatsApp or other social applications.

How do you feel about that? It's okay because, as I told you, it's the first time I'm doing it. I never did a speaking test. And I was, because of being so much stressful, I was expecting something less. You're expecting something less. Yes. Well, yeah, I mean, it was on the verge. I mean, it's a little bit of a shaky eight, but it is an eight. An eight is an eight. Thank you very much. You can even increase that by one band score. Definitely, I'll do it. You can do that. Let's look over the feedback here on your four criteria that you have been assessed on. So, we've got the fluency and coherence, the lexical resources, your vocabulary, the grammatical range and accuracy, and pronunciation. Let's start with the fluency and coherence. So, you know, the way you were speaking is, to me, it sounded very natural. I mean, you were, and you were giving reasons for your answers, elaborating on them, making every part of your speech in part one, two and three sound interesting, which is a very good point. It's a very good technique to have your stories and ideas sound interesting for the examiner, even though it's, you know, it's sort of indirectly an extra point for everybody. That's a good thing. Great, thank you. And it was sounding interesting like that. You had a few fillers, but the fillers were not language-related. They were content-related. That was you searching for an idea, which is not a problem. That happens to everyone, including native speakers. And you used boosters, you know, when you were starting one of your answers. I think it was in part three. Basically, you were comparing two things together before you even answered it. So, that was a good thing. You used that as a booster and then developed your idea. Happy to hear that. These are good things, absolutely. These are wonderful, wonderful techniques that you're using. If we're looking at your vocabulary, so, spot on. It was very much varied, in my opinion. Maybe you could use even more complex words at some point, but you were using all the necessary words and they were quite varied and very much related to the topics. So, this is very good. Strong vocabulary and being related like that. Sometimes, you were paraphrasing and using more of your vocabulary. And you can even use more if you'd like to, if you want to go for the eight eventually. Grammatical range and accuracy. So, you know, your tenses were complete. Past, present, future. It was wonderful. You were accurate, you know, most of the time. And, you know, using some nice, say, expressions, idioms, like saying, I'm crazy about singing. That kind of expression. That's good. That shows that you can know how natural you are and how accurate you are to express those opinions like that with the grammar. At one point, you said, get starving. So, it's like, get hungry. So, you don't really say, get starving. Maybe that would have, this was taking you away from the nine band score. Just a couple of things. So, you mean I shouldn't tell that I'm starving? No, it's okay. It's just to get the grammar in the correct place. Okay, that's fine. If I was really starving or something like that to really make sure it's correct. So long time, such a long time would have sounded a little bit better. So, it was just a couple of those. But, you know, you were covering all of that with the command of English that you had, which was very good. As far as I'm concerned and stuff like that, using these sort of idioms and starting your sentences, it shows to the examiner what the wide range of language structure you have. Pronunciation, I didn't have any problem with your pronunciation. I thought you were clear enough. I understood everything you said. So, yeah, it's just maybe one or two errors in the grammatical range and accuracy, then it would have been even higher. So, congratulations. I mean, you've done a great job. Thank you very much. I've learned a lot from you in this matter. So, it was really kind from you about the explanation and really nice meeting you here. Same here. And do you have any other questions for me? No, that's fine. Is everything good? Yes, great. So, we'll just go quickly just one more. Fluency, incoherence, everything. I think that's your strongest part definitely. It's so conversational and speaking so naturally. Vocabulary, just one more. So, maybe expand on it a tiny little bit and just watch it. I have to practice more. Just practice makes perfect.

Part 2 (student answering the 2nd part open question): 
Okay, I remember it was two years ago, the night of my birthday. So, it was the beginning of COVID-19 virus which was started. So, I was in doubt to, what to do for my birthday. So, I decided to invite my parents for a dinner outside. It was risky, but I thought, okay, no problem. Nothing will happen. So, I took them, my parents, my father and mother outside to a beautiful restaurant which is located in Bamland area. Bamland is a beautiful place at the west of Tehran that you can find many restaurants, different kind of food and the shopping malls. So, actually, Bamland is my favorite place and I mostly go there and visit restaurants and shopping stores. So, I gave the offer if they are okay to come with me for having dinner. So, they accepted and we went to Bamland. We went to a beautiful restaurant which serves Arabic food. We had hummus in Bab al-Bahar restaurant and the area was beautiful. The design was amazing. So, we spent about like one or two hours there and we started talking about the future, how beautiful the life is. How easy we can enjoy the life with just eating a small portion of food and enjoying the beautiful weather and being together. This is the God's mercy that we are together. Thank you.
Part 3 (student and teacher's dialogue): 
So, do people in your country prefer to eat at home or in a restaurant? What I should say is, before, maybe about, like, 20 years ago, it was in my culture, I mean, people used to eat outside, not outside, but at home. They used to cook, the mothers were the only ones who cook, and others used to eat just the food, not to do anything. But nowadays, maybe last ten days, ten years, it's more common for people to eat outside and use restaurants to not to get starving. So, nowadays it's common to eat outside for people, it's in our culture now. Okay, and what would you say are the benefits and drawbacks of eating in a restaurant? The thing is, if you eat inside the home most of the time, maybe you get bored and not to enjoy the food the way it should be. But if you go out, not every day, I mean, if you go outside sometimes and try different kind of food, like Chinese food, Mexican food, which is my favorite, of course, and Italian food, so you can do people watching, you can see different kind of people, you can meet different people, and of course, taste different kind of food and taste, and enjoy the food more, more than eating at home. Absolutely, so what do people usually cook for special festivals? We don't have many special festivals, like Thanksgiving and this kind of stuff in Iran. We have like a month called Ramadan here. They don't eat from morning to evening, and in the evening they have a small, very, very thin kind of food, not to get problem for the stomach. So most of the time they eat Ash, which is some kind of food. There are noodles inside, and yogurt, some kind of yogurt inside the Ash, which is very good for the stomach after fasting. And very famous, most famous food in Iran is Gormas Abzi, that everyone likes it. I have some friends which are not Iranian. They are crazy about it. I cook maybe two or three times for them, and they ask for more. All right, wonderful. Cool, and next one. More and more people, so they're having, people are having, or getting their meals delivered. So would people cook at home these days? In Iran? Yes. These days, before, they used to cook like traditional food, which are very common in Iran, and everyone can eat it. But nowadays, as far as I know, even me, I prefer to cook some kind of food, which are, cooking them is easier than maybe preparing everything for traditional food, because it takes so long time to make traditional food. I mostly cook fast foods, and foods that are very easy to cook. I think everyone is the same. Absolutely, and what do you think? Do you think cooking will become less common in the future? Yes, this is what I think, because, and the reason is, nowadays, people work outside. Before, just men used to work outside. But nowadays, as far as you can see, girls and women, they are working outside, so they don't have time. After the work, they have to come back home and take care of kids, and I don't know, make up the home, and this kind of stuff, so they don't have time. And in the future, it will be more common, because they will have many things to do, and there will be no time for cooking. Absolutely. Thanks very much.

So, I decided to invite my parents for a dinner outside. It was risky, but I thought, okay, no problem. Nothing will happen. So, I took them, my parents, my father and mother outside to a beautiful restaurant which is located in Bamland area. Bamland is a beautiful place at the west of Tehran that you can find many restaurants, different kind of food and the shopping malls. So, actually, Bamland is my favorite place and I mostly go there and visit restaurants and shopping stores. So, I gave the offer if they are okay to come with me for having dinner. So, they accepted and we went to Bamland. We went to a beautiful restaurant which serves Arabic food. We had hummus in Bab al-Bahar restaurant and the area was beautiful. The design was amazing. So, we spent about like one or two hours there and we started talking about the future, how beautiful the life is.

I think it makes someone to be relaxed when you hear about them. The first time that I was... heard their song, I mean, I was 40 or 30 years old, and I heard about them.

We can't judge a person by their, for example, clothing, or by their listening, when they are listening to the music, we can't do that. Perfect. Do you think pop stars can be a bad influence on teenagers? Why? I mean, pop, it depends on the person. For example, a teenager under the age of 14, 15, or 16 years old, it's not allowed because they use a lot of different kind of bad words.

When it comes to lexical resource or your vocabulary, you have a wide enough vocabulary to discuss topics at length, and you're really conveying the messages easily using some very good words. And sometimes collocations, like cultural music, you use such words in order to express your ideas. But you need to paraphrase yourself and my questions. You need to paraphrase at least the examiner's questions. For example, if I ask you a question about the benefits, the advantages of something, you can use, yes, the pros and cons of that issue. You can name them, and you can rephrase and reword my question. This is very important for each candidate to get a higher band score. So, unfortunately, you did not pay attention to this part of the speaking test. So, try to paraphrase, try to rephrase and reword the questions. And do not stick to certain words. Do not use some words over and over. Try to find some synonyms for those words. But I like the way you said that we cannot judge a person by something. We cannot judge a person by something. This is very natural. And you have not memorized it. It just came across your mind, and you used it on the spot. So, it's perfect, keep up the good work, and try to pay attention to what I told you. Paraphrasing is very important. Now, grammatical range and accuracy. Well, you are able to produce basic sentence forms with reasonable accuracy. But you have to pay attention to complex structures. Try to use conditional sentences or some conditional sentences or relative clauses, subordinate clauses, try to use them. Try to show yourself and flaunt your capability in using a wide range of complex structures. You did use simple sentence forms, which is okay, with a couple of mistakes like you said, they has, instead of they have, or have never went to a place. I have never gone to that place. You had a few mistakes here and there in the grammar, and you have to pay attention to this part in order to get a higher band score. When it comes to pronunciation, you had a few mistakes and mispronunciations. Of course, you were going on naturally, but you need to pay attention to some certain words. It's love, not lav. You said lav a couple of times. You said brine instead of brain. It's brain, not brine. So pay attention to those specific words that may be problematic for you, and just fix those problems. And also pay attention to the rise and fall and the intonation. Try to convey the messages sometimes with the rise and fall. When you use an intonation and we use the rhythm while you're speaking, your messages can be conveyed in a stronger manner. So try to pay attention to this part as well, and you will definitely be at least seven if you take care of those tips that I told you right now.",310.0,5.5,5.5,5.5,5.5,0.6542056074766355,"Talk about a singer or a music band that you listen to frequently.

I want to talk about a book. It's named... I Could Leave Me If I Could. I Leave Me If I Could. It's written by my favorite singer. Her name is Halsey. She's an American singer. And the book is a collection of poetry. I really enjoy to read these poems because I'm very interested to know people's lives and their stories. And this book is also about her life and what it's like as a well-known person and her mental issues and these things. And I should add another thing that is very important for me. It's my camera. Actually, it's a gift which my dad gave me three years ago. However, I don't go to any related courses about photography. I believe I can take good photos and my family always tells me that I have talent in it. Unfortunately, these days, because I don't have much free time, I can't go to photography courses, but I'm planning to do it in the summer.

Part 3 (student and teacher's dialogue): 
Do people in your country try new gadgets and appliances in the market? Why? Why not? I don't think so. I think Iranian people don't like to somehow try new things. Maybe the most important reason is we can't easily access to new gadgets in our country and we have to wait for a while to be able to buy them. And some people find it easy to follow instructions while assembling a gadget, but others find it difficult. Why is it so? I think always when we want to try a new thing it could be different for us, but after a while it will be easier and we used to it. Alright. Do people feel uncomfortable using new products at home or work? Why and why not? As I mentioned, it's not easy for them at first, but I think when they used to it, they become interested in them. Do people feel... well, this is what I asked already. Do advertisements play a key role in promoting innovative and trendy products these days? Definitely yes, because I think advertisements introduce us new things and without them we can't be aware of what is trend these days. And are people now preferring to buy local products than imported items? Why and why not? Could you please? Sure, I'll go again. Are people now preferring to buy local products than imported ones?

But unfortunately, my country is not like this and our schools just focus on education. They don't introduce us gadgets and how we can use technology. And did you have the same experience? Yes, for sure.

I've been living there like for five years, so far. As I said, it's my grandchild's house.

I can say that what I liked about your fluency and coherence, the first thing, was how you were developing the topic. Like, whatever question I was asking you, whether it was familiar or unfamiliar, you were able to give explanations and examples on that. As you said, part one was easier because normally, part one is all about... always, part one is about short questions and short answers. So, you find it much easier to answer some personal questions. But part two, yeah, I do agree with you. It's much harder because you have to cover the two minutes and you have to cover the bullet points and you did so. So how you answered the questions and how you covered your ideas, I really liked that. And you had some hesitations, especially in part two, because you were trying to come up with the next idea. But your hesitations were mostly content related. Like, it was because you were trying to think of the next idea you want to elaborate on. And you had some self-repetition in part two and part three. Like you repeated several words or several ideas. Maybe you could just refer to some newer ideas. But basically, I can say that what you did regarding your fluency and coherence was really good. And of course, as the last thing that I should mention here, I can refer to the range of connectives and discourse markers that you are naturally using. For example, you used the words also, either this one or the other one, basically at some point, on the other hand, as a less however. So it was really good how you were using these words in all the three parts and not just one part. It was used very flexibly and naturally. And that was a good performance. Now to talk about your lexical resource, your vocabulary. I can say that how naturally you were using the fillers and boosters to start your answer or to buy some time to just move on to the next idea was really good. And you were kind of paraphrasing the question I was asking you or even your own words or that you were using. And I could also hear some less common idiomatic vocabulary and collocations and different topics. For example, you use the word spacious instead of big, like a spacious house, spacious place of my own. And also, something comes to my mind to take out of the comfort zone, something worked out or the personal growth. So you refer to these words to give more explanations on your answers. And that was a good one. Maybe just you could use more idiomatic vocabulary and reduce your self-repetition by using a wider range of words to talk about the topics. And now to talk about your grammatical range and accuracy. Your grammar, I can say that is really to the point and neat. The way you're using the complex grammatical structures and a range of tenses, like you showed awareness to the different styles and the different tenses. I could hear present perfect, present perfect continuous. You just talked about the chain of events that happened to you from past to the present to the future. So that's a very good thing.

Alright, well, this is kind of funny because when I was writing this, a lot of things came to my mind. But I chose this specific one. I am planning to participate in a dancing contest in February, which is kind of curious. I didn't dance before, like I started dancing like four years ago. Before that, I thought that I was not able to dance. I was actually partying, sitting down, and just watching people. And when people invited me, I was saying that no, I'm not able to, I don't like it. But this actually took me out of my comfort zone. It was pretty funny the way it worked out. And I think that just participating in this contest will move me to another level in my life. I'm going to create, like, evidence that I can do things that I have always thought that I was not useful or good at. So, I have been participating... Well, I have been practicing for this contest for the last three months. So, it's kind of difficult because not a practice, actually. But it's more than being in front of a lot of people, getting all these comments, and I don't know, like, not knowing what they're thinking about me dancing. It's kind of like curious because I am used to being in front of people, because that's what I've been doing for 10 years in my life. That's my job. But this is different because this is not what I'm comfortable with. So, this ambition is important for what I said. I think I'm going to feel that I'm growing as a person.
Part 3 (student and teacher's dialogue): 
Do you share your ambitions with other people? Yes, I do. But as I am a shy person, or not a very extrovert person, I do share my ambitions with very specific people in my life, especially family and friends. And which one do you prefer, like, sharing the ambitions and your thoughts with your friends or with your family members? I think that depends on the thing that I want to share. Sometimes it's easier to share with friends. I'm expecting, like, they're going to say something about it, useful, maybe giving some recommendations. On the other hand, your family gives you a different kind of information, like, or they talk to you in a different way, maybe because it's your family. So, I know, I think it depends on how I feel, like, what kind of information I want from. Okay, and how about the children? Do you think that children should consult their parents before setting their goals? Well, it's funny, because children, what kind of goals would they have? Like, being a firefighter, maybe, policeman, astronaut, I think it's a little bit different from the goals that we have as adults. And how about the people in your country? What kinds of ambitions do they normally have? Like, where you live now. I think here where I live, people just want to be happy. Like, from the last ten years, I think people's minds and people's thoughts have changed. I think people just see themselves in the future with just being happy. Like, I don't care how, I don't care about money, I don't care about job, what job I'm performing, I just want to be happy. And now that we're talking about accomplishments and being happy, let's talk a bit about failures. So, what can be the result of failures in your idea? That's a kind of interesting question, because failing, it's a very important part in your life. I think everybody has failed at some point, and you can either learn from it or just cry about it. But at the end, it's just experience that you learn. You just want to take it in the positive way or the negative way. You can take it in the positive way, you just grow as a person, you become more mature. But what if some people do not have any ambitions? Do you think that without any ambitions, our growth may come to a standstill, or nothing will change in a negative way? I think they will stay wherever they are. I don't think that's negative, but they're not going to know what life has for them. I think when you don't have ambitions, goals, that take you out of your comfort zone, as I said before, you're just going to be there in a known place where nothing happens. So why do some people lose their ambitions gradually as they grow older? Because it's more comfortable, just stay there where you are. And it's scary to try to look for a new personal growth. Personal growth hurts, that's for sure. Going to the psychology, therapy, coaching, because they will always ask you and recommend you that you can try different things, but people that are not ready, they just won't.

2.0,"Alright, well, this is kind of funny because when I was writing this, a lot of things came to my mind. But I chose this specific one. I am planning to participate in a dancing contest in February, which is kind of curious. I didn't dance before, like I started dancing like four years ago. Before that, I thought that I was not able to dance. I was actually partying, sitting down, and just watching people. And when people invited me, I was saying that no, I'm not able to, I don't like it. But this actually took me out of my comfort zone. It was pretty funny the way it worked out. And I think that just participating in this contest will move me to another level in my life. I'm going to create, like, evidence that I can do things that I have always thought that I was not useful or good at. So, I have been participating... Well, I have been practicing for this contest for the last three months. So, it's kind of difficult because not a practice, actually. But it's more than being in front of a lot of people, getting all these comments, and I don't know, like, not knowing what they're thinking about me dancing.

I can say that what I liked about your fluency and coherence, the first thing, was how you were developing the topic. Like, whatever question I was asking you, whether it was familiar or unfamiliar, you were able to give explanations and examples on that. As you said, part one was easier because normally, part one is all about... always, part one is about short questions and short answers. So, you find it much easier to answer some personal questions. But part two, yeah, I do agree with you. It's much harder because you have to cover the two minutes and you have to cover the bullet points and you did so. So how you answered the questions and how you covered your ideas, I really liked that. And you had some hesitations, especially in part two, because you were trying to come up with the next idea. But your hesitations were mostly content related. Like, it was because you were trying to think of the next idea you want to elaborate on. And you had some self-repetition in part two and part three. Like you repeated several words or several ideas. Maybe you could just refer to some newer ideas. But basically, I can say that what you did regarding your fluency and coherence was really good. And of course, as the last thing that I should mention here, I can refer to the range of connectives and discourse markers that you are naturally using. For example, you used the words also, either this one or the other one, basically at some point, on the other hand, as a less however. So it was really good how you were using these words in all the three parts and not just one part. It was used very flexibly and naturally. And that was a good performance. Now to talk about your lexical resource, your vocabulary. I can say that how naturally you were using the fillers and boosters to start your answer or to buy some time to just move on to the next idea was really good. And you were kind of paraphrasing the question I was asking you or even your own words or that you were using. And I could also hear some less common idiomatic vocabulary and collocations and different topics. For example, you use the word spacious instead of big, like a spacious house, spacious place of my own. And also, something comes to my mind to take out of the comfort zone, something worked out or the personal growth. So you refer to these words to give more explanations on your answers. And that was a good one. Maybe just you could use more idiomatic vocabulary and reduce your self-repetition by using a wider range of words to talk about the topics. And now to talk about your grammatical range and accuracy. Your grammar, I can say that is really to the point and neat. The way you're using the complex grammatical structures and a range of tenses, like you showed awareness to the different styles and the different tenses. I could hear present perfect, present perfect continuous. You just talked about the chain of events that happened to you from past to the present to the future. So that's a very good thing.

1.0,"A big family or a small family? Compared to other families in Iran, I have a big family because we are four people and three brothers, one sister and my parents. Alright, and how much time do you spend with your family? Nowadays, unfortunately, I have no time for them because we live in separate cities and we see each other very rarely. How has your family influenced you? By many ways. From the very beginning of my life, they taught me how to walk, how to think and how to communicate with others. And after the time I got older, they taught me... Do you usually use a pen or a pencil? Let's... This is about pens and pencils. Do you usually use a pen or a pencil? Well, it quite depends on the situation. When I'm going to write something permanent, like a formal letter, I use pen. But whenever I'm just studying for myself, in my books, I use pencil. Do you think using pencils or pens give an impressive writing layout? Because of the speed of writing, when you write with pencil, you got a better handwriting. But with pen, it's changed. And how would you feel if someone gave you a pen as a gift? You know, totally I'm not very okay with gifts. I think that they impose something to you that maybe you don't like it, regardless of whatever they give you. But, I don't think... Now let's move on to talk about history. When you were a child, did you enjoy learning history? Not really, because when we were in school, I believed that they only give us some wrong information. So they just twist the reality and because of that, I didn't like to learn history. Have you ever been to a museum to learn about history? I've been to some museums, but not recently. But it was not about the history. I was just curious about seeing the stuff. And when was the last time you read a book about history? The last time I... I remember when I was in high school, I read a book about Hitler. It was the name. And it just gave me some information about the development of this person.",192.0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDBHK-hjoVU,"So, let's start with fluency and coherence. Well, of course, you were highly capable of maintaining the flow of speech and giving to the point and relative answers to the questions. It's perfect, what you did, and... but you had a couple of self-repetitions and hesitations that are, I think they were content-related. You were not searching for language and searching for words. You were searching for the ideas and how to answer the question. But you need to, of course, reduce those instances of hesitation, pauses. You do not have flunk pauses. They are okay, natural, but you need to reduce them in order to increase your BAN score. So, I like the way you connect the sentences and develop the topic and build up the topic and go to the conclusion. It was really perfect. Stick to this. Good job. But try to also use some discourse markers, fillers, and boosters in order to buy yourself some time to find a better idea or find a better answer to the question and better framing of the sentences. So, fillers and boosters and discourse markers. And you can use a diverse range of discourse markers and connectives. Do not stick to the simple connectives. Try to use however, although, and those a little bit complex connectives and diversified connectives in order to get a higher BAN score. So now let's move on to vocabulary or what we call lexical resource. You had a wide range of vocabulary. Your word treasure is perfect. You can easily talk about familiar and unfamiliar topics, but you had a few mistakes. Like when you wanted to, for example, use turn the tables in our favor, you said turn the tables in our favor, and then you added way to it. You knew that there was a mistake in this part, but you wanted to fix it. You were not successful, unfortunately, but try to pay closer attention to how the words are used. If you're not sure that this is how native speakers use this idiom, for example, do not use it, avoid it, skip it. Try to use other words or alternatives to this. So, but generally, you really shown in this part in vocabulary, you had a wide range of vocabulary. So, when it comes to grammar, you were able to use a mix of complex and simple structures. But I think sometimes candidates forget to use the complex structures. I am sure that you have the capability to use complex structures, but you did not really use a lot of complex structures like conditional sentences, subordinate clauses. Try to pay attention to this part and avoid slight mistakes that can mark you down. Mistakes that are concerned with information. You said information. I know, you know, that it's not information. It's information, even though it does not have such a plural form. It's information. Or you were talking about the past and you said, we want to get married, instead of we wanted to get married. Or you said, from that time, we have been trying since that time. We have been trying. Or nothing but, you said nothing just. You should have said nothing but. She asked me nothing but to, for example, be loyal to her. Nothing just be loyal to her is not correct. So if you pay attention to these slight problems, but very important, because the examiners know and can hunt them, yeah, on spot. Let's move on to pronunciation. You didn't have many mistakes when it comes to pronunciation, except for the word conquer. You said it conquer. And there's one more point. You should not be flat while speaking. You have to raise your voice sometimes, lower your voice. You have to have those rises and falls in order to avoid being monotonous. Being monotonous may mark you down, may make the examiner think that you are not even interested in speaking at length. You should show the examiner that you have the capacity to speak at length without any effort. So try to have those rises and falls to give a better gist to your messages, and the messages that you want to communicate with the examiner. So these are my tips. And right now, so you're 6.5, and I'm sure you're potentially at least 7 if you regard those tips. The slight mistakes that you make with grammar, if you pay attention to the discourse markers, pay closer attention to them. Try to use them. Try to use those discourse markers that can help you, buy you some time to shine even better, buy yourself some time to provide longer answers. So use them, fillers and boosters.

Part 2 (student answering the 2nd part open question): 
I want to talk about one of my most important times of my life, because one of the most significant things that I have ever done was the promise that I gave to my wife, when we want to get married. It was six years ago, I think, if I'm not mistaken, because I've got a mind like a seal. Six years ago, and we were talking about our future, and she asked me one thing, don't even let me to be alone. And I told her, be sure about it, I promise you, I will never let you alone. And from then, I think that I have done everything that I could to make this promise come true. And even when our child was born, we become more dependent on each other, and we never let each other to feel alone. Because she asked me nothing, just this specific thing. And, you know, I just want to make her happy, I can do whatever it takes to fulfill the promise I gave her six years ago. So, as I said before, we are so dependent on each other, and I try hard to give her what she asked me. And that's the one important promise that I ever promised someone.
Part 3 (student and teacher's dialogue): 
Do you think people are less committed to goals now than in the past? Why and why not? Or, somehow, prove them wrong more easily than before? At that time, for example, 10 years ago, there were no telegrams, there were no WhatsApp and there were no chats. But now, we can easily show them that here you promised me something and now you are right. What is the importance of commitment to work? I think it's one of the most important things. Because, if you want to run a successful business, you must trust each other. And the commitment is one of the key points in this issue. And, do young people show commitment towards work if they are not paid well? Why and why not? I think young people tend to show less commitment if they are not paid well. Because they are so eager, so energetic, and they want to conquer all the problems very fast. And maybe they are not so patient to their commitment when they are not satisfied with their view. And has global and social networking enabled people to be more committed or vice versa? Sorry, I didn't hear. Alright, I'll go again. Has global and social networking enabled people to be more committed or vice versa? Yeah, as I said before, the advent of social networks makes us more committed. Because in this network, we write our things and everything is recorded. So, it's very hard to turn the situation in our favorite way. I think, yeah, it's really important. And how can we teach young children to be committed to their goals and never give up? I believe that the best way to teach our youngsters, our children, is to show them how we act. For example, when we want to follow our goals, if we are committed to these goals, they will watch us and learn from us. It's not enough just to tell them this and that, it's not working. And have you experienced such a situation so far? Yes, as I told you, I have a kid and he's four years old. And me and my wife always try to stay focused on what we want, so he will learn from us.

3.0,"Do you think people are less committed to goals now than in the past? Why and why not? Or, somehow, prove them wrong more easily than before? At that time, for example, 10 years ago, there were no telegrams, there were no WhatsApp and there were no chats. But now, we can easily show them that here you promised me something and now you are right. What is the importance of commitment to work? I think it's one of the most important things. Because, if you want to run a successful business, you must trust each other. And the commitment is one of the key points in this issue. And, do young people show commitment towards work if they are not paid well? Why and why not? I think young people tend to show less commitment if they are not paid well. Because they are so eager, so energetic, and they want to conquer all the problems very fast. And maybe they are not so patient to their commitment when they are not satisfied with their view. And has global and social networking enabled people to be more committed or vice versa? Sorry, I didn't hear. Alright, I'll go again. Has global and social networking enabled people to be more committed or vice versa? Yeah, as I said before, the advent of social networks makes us more committed. Because in this network, we write our things and everything is recorded. So, it's very hard to turn the situation in our favorite way. I think, yeah, it's really important. And how can we teach young children to be committed to their goals and never give up? I believe that the best way to teach our youngsters, our children, is to show them how we act. For example, when we want to follow our goals, if we are committed to these goals, they will watch us and learn from us. It's not enough just to tell them this and that, it's not working. And have you experienced such a situation so far? Yes, as I told you, I have a kid and he's four years old. And me and my wife always try to stay focused on what we want, so he will learn from us.",217.0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDBHK-hjoVU,"So, let's start with fluency and coherence. Well, of course, you were highly capable of maintaining the flow of speech and giving to the point and relative answers to the questions. It's perfect, what you did, and... but you had a couple of self-repetitions and hesitations that are, I think they were content-related. You were not searching for language and searching for words. You were searching for the ideas and how to answer the question. But you need to, of course, reduce those instances of hesitation, pauses. You do not have flunk pauses. They are okay, natural, but you need to reduce them in order to increase your BAN score. So, I like the way you connect the sentences and develop the topic and build up the topic and go to the conclusion. It was really perfect. Stick to this. Good job. But try to also use some discourse markers, fillers, and boosters in order to buy yourself some time to find a better idea or find a better answer to the question and better framing of the sentences. So, fillers and boosters and discourse markers. And you can use a diverse range of discourse markers and connectives. Do not stick to the simple connectives. Try to use however, although, and those a little bit complex connectives and diversified connectives in order to get a higher BAN score. So now let's move on to vocabulary or what we call lexical resource. You had a wide range of vocabulary. Your word treasure is perfect. You can easily talk about familiar and unfamiliar topics, but you had a few mistakes. Like when you wanted to, for example, use turn the tables in our favor, you said turn the tables in our favor, and then you added way to it. You knew that there was a mistake in this part, but you wanted to fix it. You were not successful, unfortunately, but try to pay closer attention to how the words are used. If you're not sure that this is how native speakers use this idiom, for example, do not use it, avoid it, skip it. Try to use other words or alternatives to this. So, but generally, you really shown in this part in vocabulary, you had a wide range of vocabulary. So, when it comes to grammar, you were able to use a mix of complex and simple structures. But I think sometimes candidates forget to use the complex structures. I am sure that you have the capability to use complex structures, but you did not really use a lot of complex structures like conditional sentences, subordinate clauses. Try to pay attention to this part and avoid slight mistakes that can mark you down. Mistakes that are concerned with information. You said information. I know, you know, that it's not information. It's information, even though it does not have such a plural form. It's information. Or you were talking about the past and you said, we want to get married, instead of we wanted to get married. Or you said, from that time, we have been trying since that time. We have been trying. Or nothing but, you said nothing just. You should have said nothing but. She asked me nothing but to, for example, be loyal to her. Nothing just be loyal to her is not correct. So if you pay attention to these slight problems, but very important, because the examiners know and can hunt them, yeah, on spot. Let's move on to pronunciation. You didn't have many mistakes when it comes to pronunciation, except for the word conquer. You said it conquer. And there's one more point. You should not be flat while speaking. You have to raise your voice sometimes, lower your voice. You have to have those rises and falls in order to avoid being monotonous. Being monotonous may mark you down, may make the examiner think that you are not even interested in speaking at length. You should show the examiner that you have the capacity to speak at length without any effort. So try to have those rises and falls to give a better gist to your messages, and the messages that you want to communicate with the examiner. So these are my tips. And right now, so you're 6.5, and I'm sure you're potentially at least 7 if you regard those tips. The slight mistakes that you make with grammar, if you pay attention to the discourse markers, pay closer attention to them. Try to use them. Try to use those discourse markers that can help you, buy you some time to shine even better, buy yourself some time to provide longer answers. So use them, fillers and boosters. If you just fix those problems, you're definitely going to have a better performance in your IELTS exam.

And, the last time you saw your friends, what did you do together? I'm a cameraman, and in one project I see one person in this location, and he's another cameraman, and the job is like to me, and we have friend. Okay. And what makes a friend into a good friend? Good friend... In my opinion, my good friend, I have a... I say to you, I have one person in my life, it's my best friend, and 12 years ago, 12 years is, we have a friend, and any work, any time, I spend any time with them. Okay. Now, let's talk about movies. Okay. How often do you go to the cinema to watch a movie? I think two years ago I go to the cinema, before the Corona. I'm very good to the cinema, but when they start the Corona, I can't go to cinema. Okay. And I'm so sad for this. And do you like to watch movies alone, or with your friends? Sometime I like to see the movie alone, at night, but not always. Okay. And would you like to be in a movie? Yes, exactly. I like this, because my job is it. Right. Let's move on now to talk about the weather. Okay. What is the climate like in your country? In my country, not one climate. It's four seasons, and in one season, the weather is cloudy, rainy, sunny, snow, but I like the rainy, rainy weather. Good. Now, are there any problems with the climate in your country? Can you repeat your question? Sure. Are there any problems with the weather in your country? No. Yes. In Tehran City, the weather is so bad, because a lot of car, and around Tehran is a very mountain, and for this the weather is not very good in years.

That's... you know, you can improve that, you can improve your score and make it a 4.5, and then from there on you can increase that again, you can just go up stage by stage, step by step. So, let's look at the first steps, alright? So, right now we're looking at the overall 3.5. So, with fluency and coherence. So, this is the first part, you know, we're going to be looking at now, is... so, that's how you maintain your speech and everything. I mean, the good thing is, you have a lot... even though you have a lot of pauses, and, you know, maybe you do not understand the question all the time, you manage to maintain the, you know, conversation flow. You can continue which is not bad, that's good, that's something... that's a good thing to keep using. But, I mean, you do struggle a lot with, you know, understanding the questions, and this is very important because they want to see how coherent you are, I mean, understanding the... your command of English and how you can respond to questions. So, maybe just, you know, go through, maybe some questionnaire exercises, and, you know, listen to some simple conversation between people on the questionnaire and the person who's answering the questions. I mean, the mannerism is nice, you know, you're very friendly, you keep going, and, you know, that's great, you can keep that characteristic, it's nice. You do have a lot of, you know, self-corrections and, you know, self-repetition, but, you know, just try to maybe increase your sentence structure and record your voice at night and listen to it, and then, maybe, you can just improve your general English. So vocabulary, you use, let's say, simple vocabulary, but, you know, you can definitely increase it, maybe learn five words every day. Yes, I know. Yeah, you can do that, maybe. That's a good thing to do for you. So, just practice, try to increase your vocabulary. I mean, the vocabulary that you do know, you were using, which is good, I mean, it's good to use vocabulary that you are aware of. It's very small, but... Yeah, it's small little words, maybe you can increase that to make it a little bit more complicated, and when you learn more words, you increase your vocabulary, you have less self-repetition, so you will repeat yourself less, and you can use a wider range of vocabulary, so that would be something to look at. Let's look at grammatical range and accuracy. Now, this is probably, for you, this is the biggest problem, because, I mean, the grammar is very mixed up, let's say, with your past, present and future tense. Yeah. So, yeah, you could just practice that a lot, and that would improve your general structure of grammar and accuracy. So, talk about things in the past. So, if you went up the mountain, I was up the mountain, it was this, it was that, so it's good to do that. And you said, I'm very go, so I'm very go to the cinema, so I like to generally go to the cinema a lot. So, make sure you fix the structures of your grammatics, especially that past, present and future tenses. This is the most important thing for you right now. But, you know, good try. Pronunciation. So, pronunciation, actually, you know, you're pretty clear most of the time, with the simple words and sentences, you are quite easy to understand, I thought, most of the time, which is good. It's good to speak loud and speak up and make sure you're heard and you're clear. There was a lot of monotone with you, though. I mean, sometimes you could go with, just make sure the... it's a stress-related language, you know, English, so the more ups and downs that you use in the stress of the English language, the more, let's say, naturally you're going to sound clearer, the more you're going to understand. Everyone will understand you. You had a few mispronunciations, like, I think you said it was technologic. Maybe you wanted to say something was high-tech, it was advanced technology. That was at the end in part three of the test. But anyway, you know, good try. I think between world and word, it was, that's sort of, that's a little bit confusing for the examiner, because are you saying word or are you saying the other word, which is world, you know, they're two different words. Try to watch it with the kind of words that you're saying, try to pronounce them all properly. And, you know, if you just, if you improve on these four criteria, you'll get better. But, you know, for your level and everything, it was a very good try, especially, you know, part two, that you managed to keep going. That's very important that you do that. Just make sure you keep that that nice personality of yours and you can improve on all these little bits and pieces that I've been telling you.

But, you know, for your level and everything, it was a very good try, especially, you know, part two, that you managed to keep going. That's very important that you do that. Just make sure you keep that that nice personality of yours and you can improve on all these little bits and pieces that I've been telling you.

1.0,"Are you a student now, or do you work? I'm working as a lawyer and I graduated from a university about two years ago. And now, as I mentioned, I'm working as a lawyer and I'm really satisfied with my major. Right, and why did you choose this job? Well, as you might be well informed, this job makes me feel delighted while I'm defending people's rights. So, I chose this major for many reasons. One of the first and foremost reasons for me was defending people's rights. It was really my top priority. Right, and let's talk about your daily routine. What do you do generally? Well, I customarily do a lot of exercise each day. And in order to feel better, I can recharge my battery by doing exercise. And this really peps me up. But these days, because of the spreading of coronavirus, we cannot go to the gym. We have to stay at home and do exercise at home. OK, and is there anything about your job you would like to change? Well, if I were to alter something in my career, that would be about salary. Because they paid me peanuts about my vocation. And definitely, I would change my salary to have a handsome income. OK, and I'd like to move on now and ask you some questions about shopping. So, who does most of the shopping in your household? Well, I do. I myself do most of my shopping in my family. Because my father is retired, and my mother, unfortunately, is not keen on shopping. And she's an exception. So, I would go shopping. I'm not a shopaholic person. All right, and what type of shopping would you say you'd like? Well, it depends on different situations. But most of the time, I really prefer to go shopping and buy fresh produce for my family. OK, and let's talk about films now briefly. So, how often do you go to the cinema? Well, for my money, these days, going to the cinema and these public places are really injurious. And because of the spreading of coronavirus, it's really perilous to go to the cinema. But I can vividly remember that about two years ago, I went to the cinema. And I watched a brilliant and great movie. It was a blast. OK, thank you very much.",246.0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlgHPqjz1sY,"So, I think as a whole, you know, we're, at the moment, we're probably looking at a 6.5. I wanted to give you 7, actually. Because you had a lot of, you know, you had a lot of power in your pronunciations and, you know, great range of vocabulary. There were certain hesitations here and there that prevented me from doing that. I really wanted to give you the 7. So, at the moment, we're looking at a 6.5. But don't worry about that, because that, you can increase one band score, actually, in your situation. First, we're gonna have a look at some issues. So, what we're looking at here? If we're looking at coherence and, you know, fluency and, basically, your paraphrasing techniques were wonderful. You know, I love the way you were paraphrasing and, you know, coming up with all these linking words, which are important issues when you're taking the IELTS speaking test. And, you know, your start to the answers were very good, the way you were referring to the question, and you fully understood the answers. I had no problems with that. You had some of these, you know, ""-ons,"" here and there. That can be fixed. Again, maybe, again, just stick to the linking words and that'll help, you know, stop you do all these ""-ons,"" and, you know, being hesitant like that. What I would like to look at is also the collocations. I think you had a good use of the collocations and the way you were rewording stuff and, you know, using all these expressions. Some of the jargons, I would say, that maybe they were misplaced. Maybe once or twice. Mostly, they were in the correct place, but maybe you were using too many of them as if they were kind of memorized. I mean, memorizing certain words and phrases in English is something what all candidates would do, anyone who's learning English. That's fine. There's nothing wrong with that. But sometimes, you know, if you're using them too much, if you're too often, you know, using them, then the examiner will think to him or herself. It sounds unnatural. It might sound a little bit unnatural, exactly. And that would affect the fluency and coherence, because being coherent means, obviously, sounding natural. But altogether, you know, I liked your intonation. You know, when you were talking, you sounded pretty comfortable with that. In terms of vocabulary, I don't have a problem with your vocabulary personally. I think you have a wide range of vocabulary and you were using the vocab in the correct places. And you could prove that you could use a wide range of vocabulary. I don't have a problem with that at all. So, I wouldn't focus too much on the vocab from now. Grammar and accuracy. You see, here and there, with linking certain sentences, creating these complex structures of sentences, I felt that you struggled here and there. There were some errors. You know, you had more erms and you missed some of the prepositions. Like, for example, we can human beings. You know, we can be better human beings. Maybe you were trying to think of certain linking words or prepositions just to fix your sentences. That's the most, erm, I mean, that's the highlighted thing I have here for you if you want to improve with the high band score. Definitely, what I would do is work on your grammar and basically, come up with your complex sentences. Your simple sentences are fine. I don't think you have any problem with that. The best thing to do would be to practice more of the complex structures of sentences and make sure you fit in all these prepositions. Just record your voice over and over again, you know, maybe do five sentences a night. That would be great. And because you've got the complex part of the language OK, we can see that you can use complex words and phrases. The best thing to do would be linking all your prepositions to make sure you get that accurate grammar in your sentences. That's the main issue here. Again, with the pronunciation, I do not have a problem with your pronunciation. Same with the vocabulary. Pronunciation was fabulous. I don't think, I didn't find that you mispronounced anything. I thought it was all very fluent and it was clear, you speak clearly, which is again a very important point for examiners when you're doing the IELTS speaking test. So, vocab and pronunciation, I would say definitely stick to what you have with the vocab and pronunciation. You do not have a problem with that. Definitely work on the way you sound natural and maybe avoid using too many expressions and jargons. The collocations, I'd say they were OK. You learned how to use them alright. The start to your answers and the way you produce your ideas, that's very good. Your ideas are there. Ideas are very important for part two and part three when you're talking to the examiner especially. So, yeah, definitely I would work on the coherent stuff and learning how to sound more natural. Maybe you could stick to more simple sentences when you're talking about a simple topic rather than go into too many jargons and expressions or idioms and stuff like that. You could reduce that a little bit. Again, with the grammar and accuracy, I would work a lot on your grammar. That's probably where you have the most problems with the prepositions and to have them not misplaced because that will, unfortunately, it will mark you down. But again, the rest of it, I'd say you're right. You could definitely increase one band score so you could easily get to a 7.5, I'd say, if you just tone down a little bit on those jargons. Work on your, focus more on the grammar, the simple stuff and you should be OK. ",358.0,6.5,6.5,6.5,6.5,0.6243654822335025,"

Part 2 (student answering the 2nd part open question): 
Okay, well, I can vividly remember about one of my pivotal part and turning point in my life. It was about my military exemption. When I recognised that I was exempted from military service, I was really exhilarated and really I was walking on air. It was really great and my father actually told me this news while I was alighting from the bus. So, I was going to institute and I was a solitary figure at that time and, believe it or not, I was really suddenly shouting and started shouting and on the spur of the moment I really desired to shout and burst into tears because of this great news that I heard. So, this news, for me, really crucial at that time and I reckon that for most of boys this is great news for them. And this is really great when you hear such news because it's, as you might be well informed, compulsory in our country and we have to actually military service. It's a kind of... Thank you very much. It's great.
Part 3 (student and teacher's dialogue): 
What days are important in your country? Well, the first and foremost event in my country is Nowruz, as an international event. And because people these days, people in this ceremony, they are really delighted and they always seek for new things. And they can buy different things. So, Nowruz as this ceremony and event for my country, really, it is crucial, important. All people like to participate in this, actually, event. Okay, and why is it important to have national celebrations, do you think? Well, I reckon that having national celebrations, generally, it means that it gives some identification for each country. So, this is crucial and imperative for each society to have these kinds of celebrations in their country. Because it can provide them with a great opportunity to introduce themselves to other societies. Okay, and how is the way your national celebrations being celebrated now differ from how they were celebrated in the past? Well, there is a sharp distinction between the celebrations that now people have and people used to these celebrations in the past. For instance, in the past, they might have held this celebration in a simple way, but these days, people are much prone to have these celebrations in a luxury way. Because most of people are living in a lap of luxury. So, they really desire to hold these celebrations with a great entertainment and with a great opportunity to introduce themselves to each other. And sometimes it changes to play up, they want to show off with their things to each other. All right, and do you think there will be any new celebrations in the future in your country? Well, nobody knows what the future holds, but generally speaking, it would happen maybe in the future. We can add different celebrations in our cultures, but I do believe that we should maintain our culture that we have these days and in the past. But on the other hand, we can actually add some new celebrations. All right, and what are the benefits of having events that many people around the world are celebrating on the same day? Well, to my mind, it can evince some solidarity among nations. So, it can really show that we can human beings and we can celebrate these events with each other. And it's really spectacular when we have these kinds of events at the same time with different countries. And we can feel that all the people around the world are delighted. And because of that, it can give us great energy and positive energy. Thank you very much.

1.0,"Do you study English now? I don't study English as a foreign language or to become a teacher. However, English is part of my programme because I'm in a Master of Inter-American Studies. And if you could change to another language, what would it be? That would be Spanish because, as I said, my programme is in Inter-American Studies and it actually involves English and Spanish. Which one do you think is more important, research or teaching? That is a very difficult question but because I think both are very important. However, if I had to choose one, I would probably say it's teaching because what good is all the research we are doing if we don't teach it to other people, if we don't pass it on to the younger generation, for example. Now, let's move on to talk about toys. What was your favourite toy in childhood? I'm not sure if I had, like, one favourite toy, but my siblings and I, we played a lot with little animal figurines we had at home and we used to take them to all parts of the house and garden and my parents would probably say that those were, like, the favourite toys of my brother, my sister and I. So, should parents buy many toys for their children? I don't think it's very important that it's many, it's more important that you can get attached to these toys and that you can use them more than once and not just these disposable toys that you throw in the garbage after one use. What are the benefits of children playing toys? I would say there are several benefits because, for example, if it's a toy that you can share, children can learn how to share things and how to interact with other children or other adults and also there are toys that can force the creativity and imagination and that's really nice if you can do it in a playful way. Now, let's move on to talk about reading. Do you like reading? I love reading. My bachelor degree was in Literary and Cultural Studies, actually, so I do read a lot and I really enjoy doing it. And do you read electric books? I have read electric books, but it's not really my cup of tea, so to say, because I really like to be able to put my hands on the books and smell them and then, after I read them, put them on the shelf and have a look at them when I walk past. And what was your favorite book as a child? That would probably be Harry Potter, and I still really like that book because it was the one book that really got me into reading because I started reading it when we were on vacation with my family and that was the point from when I always took a book and my parents always found me in bed at night reading.",194.0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtIVUR0BckQ,"So, to talk about your fluency and coherence, I can say that it was a very good performance, because you were quite fluent when you were talking to me. And the very good thing is that you were speaking very naturally. You were not trying to memorize, I mean, use memorized language or remember the things that you planned to say or to talk about in different topics. It was all very natural. And other than that, you had some hesitations, but very natural hesitations, because you can pause when you don't remember the language, the vocabulary, the grammar, and that is not a good thing in your fluency and coherence. But your pauses were all content related, like, you were pausing because you were thinking of the next idea. And of course, you didn't have many pauses, it was just, you know, a few pauses, natural ones. Besides, I can talk about your topic development. In part one, you were to give me some short answers. In part two, to cover your two minutes and to talk about all the bullet points. And in part three, some longer answers. And you did so. You... how you explained and how you covered your ideas. You said something, then you gave me more explanations and examples to just support what you had said. So it was a really good one here. And the last thing regarding your fluency and coherence is how you used different discourse markers and connectives to just go on, like with different parts or different topics. For example, you used the word however, also, even though, rather than, so, that, unless. And it was all used in the correct place, in the correct sentence. So being error-free is something that really matters in IELTS speaking that, of course, you were error-free. And some discourse markers, so to say, actually, and other words as well. So yes, it was really good. I really liked your fluency and coherence, talking about the, based on the band descriptors. And now to talk about the next criteria, your lexical resource, your vocabulary. In your lexical resource, you know, some things matter. The first one is how you used a range of words, vocabulary. I could hear some collocations, mediumatic vocabulary, and you were just using them all very flexibly. And besides the use of boosters and fillers, you didn't give me the answer very directly and straight away. It was in a way that you just bought yourself some time to just think of what you want to say, and then you gave me the answer. And that's okay. Like you said, yeah, that's a very good question. That's an interesting question. And then you just kept talking. So how you use fillers and boosters, how you use the range of collocations, vocabulary, very flexibly. And your paraphrasing was also good. I would say one little thing that you can work on is how you paraphrase the examiner's question, because you shouldn't repeat the exact same question. And at times you were doing it. So, I mean, the synonyms you used or vocabulary to name some, to mention some, for example, my sibling instead of my sisters or the following day, instead of the next day, make a reservation to walk past something to be impressed, or when people are dedicated, I mean, dedicate their time to something. So it was all really good how you were using the words, but how you were paraphrasing your own words or sentences, maybe you could paraphrase my questions as well, not to repeat the same words. That's the only thing I can talk about here in this criteria. And now your grammatical range and accuracy. What was really, I mean, what I can really mention regarding your grammatical range and accuracy is that first of all, you were error-free, just like how you were using the connectives and structures, because it is really important to use the appropriate structures in the sentences. And you were using a range of different tenses. I used to, or those past tenses, present, future, other than the conditional sentences, relative cause, and also compound sentences, subordinate causes. So different, different complex structures that you are using very naturally and flexibly. And of course, the connectives you used that I mentioned in the fluency and coherence really helps you with making these complex structures. So really great performance. And finally, your pronunciation, your pronunciation was also very easy and clear to understand how you were pronouncing different words or using the other pronunciation features like the word stress, the sentences stress, and your intonation. It was not like you were speaking to me in a very flat mode. It was all, you were just playing with your voice, depending on, is it a sentence? Is it a question? What kind of question is it? So you were just talking to me naturally, you know, you were not trying. I tried to. And it was a very good attempt. Thank you. So yes, this is all about the criteria, your fluency and coherence, vocabulary, lexical resource, grammatical range, and accuracy, and pronunciation. So Genevieve, to talk about your, it's okay, to talk about your overall band score, I can, of course, I can say you got a nine today. And you should really be happy about that. I am. That is really nice. Great. Thank you. And thank you so much. You're welcome. It was a very good performance. The only thing that you can work a bit on is maybe to paraphrase a bit better. And you can, of course, use an even wider range of vocabulary, or idiomatic vocabulary, you're able to do that.",366.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,0.388,"Describe the time when you first talked in a foreign language.
You should say:
1) what language it was
2) with whom you spoke
3) what you said
and explain how you felt about the conversation.",False,False,"Part 1 (student and teacher's dialogue): 
Do you study English now? I don't study English as a foreign language or to become a teacher. However, English is part of my programme because I'm in a Master of Inter-American Studies. And if you could change to another language, what would it be? That would be Spanish because, as I said, my programme is in Inter-American Studies and it actually involves English and Spanish. Which one do you think is more important, research or teaching? That is a very difficult question but because I think both are very important. However, if I had to choose one, I would probably say it's teaching because what good is all the research we are doing if we don't teach it to other people, if we don't pass it on to the younger generation, for example. Now, let's move on to talk about toys. What was your favourite toy in childhood? I'm not sure if I had, like, one favourite toy, but my siblings and I, we played a lot with little animal figurines we had at home and we used to take them to all parts of the house and garden and my parents would probably say that those were, like, the favourite toys of my brother, my sister and I. So, should parents buy many toys for their children? I don't think it's very important that it's many, it's more important that you can get attached to these toys and that you can use them more than once and not just these disposable toys that you throw in the garbage after one use. What are the benefits of children playing toys? I would say there are several benefits because, for example, if it's a toy that you can share, children can learn how to share things and how to interact with other children or other adults and also there are toys that can force the creativity and imagination and that's really nice if you can do it in a playful way. Now, let's move on to talk about reading. Do you like reading? I love reading. My bachelor degree was in Literary and Cultural Studies, actually, so I do read a lot and I really enjoy doing it. And do you read electric books? I have read electric books, but it's not really my cup of tea, so to say, because I really like to be able to put my hands on the books and smell them and then, after I read them, put them on the shelf and have a look at them when I walk past. And what was your favorite book as a child? That would probably be Harry Potter, and I still really like that book because it was the one book that really got me into reading because I started reading it when we were on vacation with my family and that was the point from when I always took a book and my parents always found me in bed at night reading.
Part 2 (student answering the 2nd part open question): 
Okay, so, the first time I spoke a foreign language outside the classroom, that would have been on vacation in Spain, but it was English actually, because that was, I think, in year two or three, so I was still quite little, and me and my family, we wanted to visit a canyon to do a hike there, but it had limited access for tourists, so there was also a limited amount of, a number of tourists you could visit every day, and that day, when we went, it was already, like, they had already approached the maximum number of tourists, so my mom didn't really speak English, or she didn't want to, so my sister and I, we went and we asked to make a reservation for the following day, and we explained that it would be the four of us, and so, the women understood us very well, and I felt very proud of myself and my sister as well, because we were quite little still, but we felt a bit like grown-ups in this moment, and very proud also to be able to help my parents, because usually, I mean, at this age, it's the other way around, right? The parents help the children, but in this case, we were able to, well, talk to the woman at the entrance and explain what we wanted to do, and yeah, she understood us, and she also was very sweet to us, and she also said that we did very well, that she was impressed how well we could speak English, even though we were that little, and then, yeah, actually the next day, we went back, and we also, again, I approached the person at the entrance, it was a different one, and said that we had made a reservation the previous day, and that we would like to visit the canyon now, and it was no problem, so I was very glad about that.
Part 3 (student and teacher's dialogue): 
Yes. I think that depends a bit on the person, but probably the most common motivation is to be able to talk to people from other countries, who have a different cultural background, who speak a different language, because I think that being able to speak a foreign language really opens doors to you. Because even if you go to a different country, if you don't speak the language, people are less willing to share information with you, and if you do approach the people in their own language, they are usually very glad to help you out and to explain more. So, what is the best way to learn a foreign language? Through reading, through writing or through speaking? For me, personally, it's listening and speaking, and just, you know, kind of trial and error. But I do think that depends a lot on the person and their personality, because I think an introvert person would probably rather study at home, and read and write and study maybe the grammar, rather than approach a different person directly and practice their speaking skills. Now let's talk a bit about children. Is it important to teach children foreign languages when they are little? I think it can be very helpful, because if they are younger, they naturally learn easier and faster, and you can just teach them a different language in a playful way, so that they get used to it from an early age. So, do you think that children learn a foreign language faster than adults? Yes, I do think so. However, I do also think that it depends on the motivation. Because a child that learns, for example, English in school, but doesn't really want to learn it, only because it's part of the curriculum, will probably not learn it faster than an adult who's really interested in learning it because they want to move abroad and need it for their job or for their studies. So, at what age do you think that children should start learning a foreign language? Probably the younger, the better. But I think if I had to put an age, I would say when they enter school, because this is also when they will have to get used to having this routine of studying and have a schedule for the day. And how about the minority languages? Do you think that they will disappear one day? Unfortunately, I think they will disappear unless we support the use and the teaching of it. So, I think there are a lot of programs, actually, which are working on this. Like people who are dedicated on spreading the use of it or also teaching it to the next generation.

So, when it comes to fluency and coherence, you were able to speak at length. That's undoubtedly. Okay, but sometimes you, you will lose your coherence. You do not find the words, and that is because I think you're a little bit stressed out. Yeah. And you, you spoke rapidly. You spoke, spoke very fast. So, try to slow it down. Try to keep pace, and find the ideas, and use some more fillers and boosters. And, in one instance, you did say, it's a tough question I need to think. That's a good way of finding the words, and finding even the ideas. Try to use more such boosters. And what you need to do in order to increase your band score, especially in fluency and coherence, you need to use a range of connectives. You just use simple ones. And so, you connected the words using, you connected the sentences using simple connectives. Try to use more, and a wider range of connectives, and linking words in order to flaunt your control over English language. So, when it comes to lexical resource, and that's to say, vocabulary, you did have enough range of vocabulary to talk about familiar, and even unfamiliar topics. But sometimes you picked the wrong words, or sometimes you pick the wrong terms to describe a certain situation. For example, you said, infection disease instead of infectious disease, right? So, and it's, you said, I, or they should learn. They should learn them. It's, they should teach them. So, the difference between teach and learn, if you pay closer attention to those, perhaps subtle differences between different words, and how to use them, or to use them, you would definitely, and easily increase your band score. Some collocations are very important to be uttered perfectly and correctly. Like, they impose a ban on someone. You said, they have ban for you. They imposed a ban on you. If you use the collocations correctly, that will definitely boost your band score. And I did, you did use some perfect collocations, like, in comparison with. It's perfect. But you need to keep going and use more such correct and accurate forms of collocations. You need to also paraphrase the question of the examiner. I need to paraphrase it, put it in another way, and then answer the question. This will help you have a better performance. When it comes to grammar, you had some subtle problems. Of course, you, you have a command of grammatical structures, but you need to, first of all, use more complex structures. I know you know that how to use conditional sentences, for example. If I do something, I will achieve something, right? If I did, I would, right? So, those complex structures, you know them, but sometimes you forget to use them. If you use them, that will definitely catch the eye of the examiner and he or she would give you a higher band score. So, and you had a couple of perhaps minor problems in the simple forms of the sentences. Like you said, they hid in their hair. I think you're, you were talking about hiding. Hiding, yeah. Right? They hide their hair. Or, I prefer to do something. You said, I prefer to walking. I prefer to walk. So, I, you were a little bit stressed out and the rhythm and the pace of your speech was, was high. So, try to slow it down in order to give yourself some time to think and speak confidently. Of course, you were confident, but you need to keep it slow. Yeah, right. So, that will help you have better fluency and even sound more confident and coherent. What else? You said, use from their time. The prepositions, you have to pay more attention to how to use the prepositions. Use their time. Use public services. It's not use from public services or use from something. Delete the from. It's just use something. Use public services. So, this is with regards to grammar. And the final part is pronunciation. You had a very beautiful pronunciation of the words. You had the intonation. You had the rise and fall and the rhythm. This is perfect. Keep up this good job. But there are minor mistakes in the pronunciation of some of the words, like you said, religious. It's religious. Religious. Or striking, you said, stricking. And weather, you said, weather. So, try to work more on how to say, well, water. It's not water. It's water, weather. It's not weather or water.

Maybe sometimes I will go to the park or walking in the streets or somewhere, but I prefer to walking in front of my environment, like in home, while I'm staying at home.

It's a problem, it's an issue, it's a very, you know, sophisticated skill that people must learn about using the cars. Not just at everyday vault and going to picnic. They want to use all just with their car, their own car, and it's not good, I think. What problems can we face if the pollution levels keep rising? Heart attack, I believe, or disease, infection disease, I believe we must care about this when we have lots of, when air pollution increase. So elderly people may feel heart attack and lots of disease caused about pollution. And there is lots of things they can mention about the weather, about the bad weather that we have.

Yeah, you know, you might say like this is a smoke-free zone or alcohol-free zone, where you cannot do that. Oh yeah, I was a bit like, I got a misunderstanding because I thought that word was like kids-free. Yeah, that's the same thing. Right. No kids zone. Yeah, no kids zone.

Yeah, there's a few grammars that I'll just point out to you, nothing too major. Maybe one time I asked you about your opinion about childhood and adulthood. You said like, I'll guess that. Neither of them are boring. Instead of I'll guess, I think it's better to say like, I would say. I would say, or in my opinion, or I believe, instead of guessing. There was one time when you're talking about a time that was very, you said that time is very bored. So make sure it's ING in that situation. Like maybe high school is boring, like students feel bored. I think you know yourself anyway. But ED is your feeling or a person's feeling and ING is describing the situation. So that time is really boring for them. One thing about countable, uncountable is news. Instead of news are true, the news is true. You could say news stories there. So those news stories are true.

Other one is about public transportation. Instead of saying in the public transportation, you should say on, on the subway, on a bus, you know. So when people are on public transportation, they should be quiet. Okay, because they have to share, I think you said share their places to each other. It should be share with each other, they have to share that area. You could also say like, it's a common area. A common area meaning a shared area. Yeah, the pronunciation was great. There was a couple of words there. Maybe politics, politics. I think it was the word stress. So yeah, politics and a little bit one library. So make sure you're pronouncing that one as well.

Part 2 (student answering the 2nd part open question): 
The time when some people near me made a lot of noise is when I was in the, like, loud subway. We were using the public transportation, and the subway was very crowded, so there were a lot of people, and my friends, my friend was making a short call with her boyfriend, and her voice got louder and louder because of the crowded people, like, the loud noises that the people made. So, that time was when she made a lot of noise, so, like, I felt a bit frustrated about her loud voice because I think people should be, like, need etiquette in the public transportation, so I wanted her to be quiet, so I asked her to lower her voice, but still, she was a bit, like, excited by calling her boyfriend, so she didn't lower her voice, so that made me a lot of, like, frustrated, and also it gave me a bit of, like, anxiety. So, that time was when my nearest person made a lot of noise. That thing first came in my mind. Okay. Okay, so that was 1 minute 15 total. Okay. Do you think on the subway in your country, are people usually quiet or not? I think it depends on the time that you get on the subway because when it's, like, the time when they all finish their work, there are a lot of people in there, and I think that time is very quiet because they all look at their phones and they use the internet in the subway because in our country, the internet, the Wi-Fi in the subway, but the public transportation is so good.
Part 3 (student and teacher's dialogue): 
So, what kind of places should be noise-free? I think the most noise-free place that was, like, that took my mind was the playground and the parks because that place is outside and that is made for people to rest very freely and also the children could play there, like, whatever they want. So, they could scream and, like, yell to each other by a fun way. So, I think that place is the most noise-free place for me. And do you think it's easy to access those places in your country? Yes, because in our country, we have a capital city, in the capital city, we have a large river named Han River and that place is very accessible in any places because that river is, like, in the middle of our capital city. Okay, and on what occasions do people need to be quiet? As I told you in part two, I think that people should be quiet in the public transportation because that is a place that many people use and they have to share their places to each other. So, I think that people should, I wish that people could be quiet in that place. Nice. And do you think people should be allowed to make noise in all public areas? Not really because, as I told you, in the transportation, people are moving to another place from where they are. So, I think that place should be un-noisy for people's anxiety. I think it's because of my anxiety because I have a very weak ear. So, I'm a bit feel frustrated about the loud noises. And how do people usually react if other people are making excessive noise? The first thing is that I think people ignore it because in our country, it's very important to respect other people's opinions. So, I think the first one will be ignoring it but the second one should be asking them to be quiet because, yeah, that would be a bit of communication that people could do. Yeah, and do you think most people can do that effectively? Definitely. There should be many different opinions about that but for me, that is very, like, I feel it very easy to do that thing to make people quiet. I could, like, ask them to be quiet because, as I told you, I'm a person who studied about communication. Mm, okay. And why can't people make noise in libraries or museums? I think it's because the libraries and museums should be a place where people have to focus on a specific thing, like in the library, they should focus on their books that they want to borrow and in the museum, there should be some, like, art or, like, those things that are in the museum. So, people should focus on there. So, if people become loud in that place, they are disrupting other people. So, that would be a rude thing. Mm, and do you think going to a museum is a common pastime in your country? Yes, I think that is a very common thing to do in my country because I remember that when I was in elementary school and also middle school, we had this field trip going to the museums every year and also we have many large museums in the capital city. So, many people could go there very easily.

2.0,"The time when some people near me made a lot of noise is when I was in the, like, loud subway. We were using the public transportation, and the subway was very crowded, so there were a lot of people, and my friends, my friend was making a short call with her boyfriend, and her voice got louder and louder because of the crowded people, like, the loud noises that the people made. So, that time was when she made a lot of noise, so, like, I felt a bit frustrated about her loud voice because I think people should be, like, need etiquette in the public transportation, so I wanted her to be quiet, so I asked her to lower her voice, but still, she was a bit, like, excited by calling her boyfriend, so she didn't lower her voice, so that made me a lot of, like, frustrated, and also it gave me a bit of, like, anxiety. So, that time was when my nearest person made a lot of noise. That thing first came in my mind. Okay. Okay, so that was 1 minute 15 total. Okay. Do you think on the subway in your country, are people usually quiet or not? I think it depends on the time that you get on the subway because when it's, like, the time when they all finish their work, there are a lot of people in there, and I think that time is very quiet because they all look at their phones and they use the internet in the subway because in our country, the internet, the Wi-Fi in the subway, but the public transportation is so good.",113.0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-awN8jpvDFo,"I would estimate your score to be 7.0.

So, they could scream and, like, yell to each other by a fun way. So, I think that place is the most noise-free place for me. And do you think it's easy to access those places in your country? Yes, because in our country, we have a capital city, in the capital city, we have a large river named Han River and that place is very accessible in any places because that river is, like, in the middle of our capital city.

Part 2 (student answering the 2nd part open question): 
So, there is a dress that I wore for Christmas party in Germany last year. It's a black silk dress with patterned laces, long sleeve. It comes down until my ankle, and it has thin fabric and has elegant features in there. So, in Korea, I bought it, and before I go to Germany, I bought it from Korean mall called Zara. So, it was a little bit expensive, but I just wanted to prepare something special because I knew that Christmas time is going to be something fancy in Europe, and it's my first time facing Christmas time, so I just wanted to wear that. So, I wore it at Christmas party, finally, and while I was wearing it, I felt like I'm in a fancy place, because a lot of people there at the site were all wearing some suits and Christmas dresses, so I thought, okay, I guess I'm lucky that I prepared enough because actually Christmas is not a big thing in Korea, but it seems like it's a huge event in Europe. So, yeah, I felt special while I was wearing that dress.
Part 3 (student and teacher's dialogue): 
So, what do you think the clothes we wear say about us? It represents our character and the lifestyle that we are aiming for. For example, even though I like high heels and mini skirts, I don't wear it that often because I really like to be comfortable and I like casual clothes so I can be active and meet a lot of people while I'm outside. Um, my hobby is walking outside, socializing, and going to events and whenever I wear some fancy clothes, it was not comfortable at all. So, for me, clothes is something that represents your character and yeah, so it represents a special vibe of a person. Okay! And do you think that brand name is very important for clothes sales? Hmmm... Sometimes. If you are a seller, I think it is important but for a person who's buying, I don't think that's that important. Yeah, because, um, I always have a lot of clothes with me in my closet but they're not brand things. I'm a student so I cannot afford them. So, yeah, if it's cheap but having a good quality, I don't think that's important. And why do you think some people like to go clothes shopping with friends? Hmmm... It's really fun, especially girls. When I'm going with my girlfriends, I can show them my style and they can also show me their style and yeah, we can just compare what kind of things that we like and it's just really fun. It's like food shopping. And how have clothes fashions changed in your country over the past few decades? Hmmm... It's hard to tell because the trend is actually always going around. So these days, I can sometimes see the 80s or 90s fashion is arising again. So these days, it's retro style but also hip style is kind of mixed together. And what kind of things determine what is in fashion? Can you say one more time? Yep! What kind of things determine what is in fashion? Hmmm... Actually, I'm not really well known in fashion so I don't know about that. Okay. And how do you think fashion will change in the future? Hmmm... I think it will just take a turn like a circulation. So I have no idea how it's going to be changed. But whenever I see Vogue models or the fashion magazine or the runway show, always the fashion in there has been quite unique and modern and sometimes kind of weird. So people are actually aiming for individuality more and more. So sometimes I think it can go extreme. So in the future, the new generation will aim for something unique that is even on the level of being weird. Yeah, and people will find it unique.

I'm currently attending Gwanghwagun University, and I'm majoring in STEM CELLS, and I'm also doing a part-time job at various places. I'm doing interviews for new members at an English academy, and I'm also teaching middle school students English. And, could you tell me about your hometown? I lived in Mapo when I was young, near Hongik University, and it was a loud, very lively place, but since I was a young girl myself, I really liked that town, so that's one of the reasons I'm visiting there very often. So, like I said, I work at an English academy, and actually, that English academy is near Hongdae, and that's one of the reasons I chose to work there, and the hometown I'm living right now, at the moment, is in Gangseo, near Parks and Station. It's not as lively or loud as the place I used to live, but it has lots of great foods and stores, so, yeah, I really enjoy living there. Okay, now we'll talk about collecting things. So, do you collect anything? I actually collect photo cards, you know, like when you buy an album, there are either one or two photo cards, and I really like those exclusive photo cards, so that's actually one of my hobbies. Okay, and are there any things that you keep from your childhood? Oh, yes, I still have my doll that I got from my eighth birthday, so now I am 21 years old, so the doll is now 13 years old, so it's quite old, but I actually went to a doll doctor once, like two years ago, it's actually near here, in Shindong Station, so they have a doll doctor for animal dolls, so my doll is a bear, so I got it totally fixed, so it's like almost good as new now. Great, and what are some common things that people usually collect? One of my friends collect books, and I think actually that's very common thing to collect, maybe like comic books, or series of books like Twilight or like Harry Potter. Okay, now we're going to talk about money, so do you prefer to save money or spend money? I prefer to save money, so I try to save money as much as I can, I usually save money for a six-month plan, because every six months I usually go on a trip, and while going on a trip, I kind of like spend most of the money that I save, so in those six months I try to save as much as I can. And how do you save money? I have this account only for saving, the money never comes out unless I go on a trip, so I have that account, so when I get my monthly paycheck from where I work, I put about 80% of the whole money in that account, and I only spend the 20 left over, and when I get some little amount of money from my grandparents or my parents or any other relatives, I also collect that money and I put it at that account. And do you usually use a card or cash? I usually use card, but in winter season I carry a little amount of cash, maybe like 5,000 won or so, because at winter there are lots of winter-only foods such as bungeoppang or hotteok, and I really love those stuff, and those people usually only get cash only, so I try to carry some money around those times.",323.0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKXib7ikpyU,"Go through it.

When you're talking about, like, areas in Seoul, you talk about, like, Mapo-gu or somewhere like that. You mentioned the word town. I probably wouldn't say town, I would say, like, area or neighborhood. A town is somewhere that's smaller than a city. It's not inside the city. So, yeah, I would say, like, Gangnam is a busy neighborhood or it's a busy area. I think that's better to say. When you talked about your gift that I got, I think you said, got from my eighth birthday, I would say, like, got for my eighth birthday. From, you would say, like, the person. I got it from my parents for my eighth birthday, right? A few prepositions here, when you talked about your savings account, you said put it at that account. It should be in that account. Yeah, when you talk about bank accounts, put it in the account, right? When you mentioned maybe, like, winter, also winter is a season. So, for seasons, we must say in. Yeah, so, for months and seasons and years, we should say in. So, in winter, you know, in July, in 2024, right? Just some word choice here as well. When you talked about cash, you know, you talked about hotteok or like that, you said some places, they get cash only. I would say better verbs to use would be, like, take or accept. Oh, exactly. Yeah, yeah. They, like, you could say they don't accept card. They don't take card. They only accept cash, right? Okay, part two was good. You spoke for a minute and 20. So, the maximum speaking time is two minutes. So, if you've got more details to add, I would add to it. I think, after your speech, I asked you again, like, the last part, like, how you felt about it. So, you could maybe give a little bit more detail there, but that was nice. What do we see here? When you talked about taking it to a police station, you said a near police station. In that case, you should say nearby, because nearby can be used as an adjective, a nearby police station. And also, we saw a news. Make sure news is uncountable. Okay, so, we saw, we saw news. You could say we saw a news story. You could say it like that. What else could we got? So, yeah, for the police station, like put it into the police station, I think a better term there would be hand it into. So, hand it into the police station, yeah. So, like, we considered handing it into the police station or just leaving it there. Yeah, that was great. In part three, when you talked about one thing, you talked about if you lose AirPods or an earbud, you said like check it on Google. Maybe a better word than check would be track, track it. If you use an electronic device, you should track it. Yeah. Also in part three, make sure that you don't talk about like your personal story. But part three is more like people in general. So, you'll notice in the part three questions, like what kind of things do people often use? Why do some people find lost items? So, rather than your personal story, you should speak generally. Yeah, but that was good test.",238.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,0.53125,"Describe a time when you found an item that someone else lost.

And, Yoonjae, are you working, or are you a student? I'm actually both. I'm currently attending Gwanghwagun University, and I'm majoring in STEM CELLS, and I'm also doing a part-time job at various places. I'm doing interviews for new members at an English academy, and I'm also teaching middle school students English. And, could you tell me about your hometown? I lived in Mapo when I was young, near Hongik University, and it was a loud, very lively place, but since I was a young girl myself, I really liked that town, so that's one of the reasons I'm visiting there very often. So, like I said, I work at an English academy, and actually, that English academy is near Hongdae, and that's one of the reasons I chose to work there, and the hometown I'm living right now, at the moment, is in Gangseo, near Parks and Station. It's not as lively or loud as the place I used to live, but it has lots of great foods and stores, so, yeah, I really enjoy living there. Okay, now we'll talk about collecting things. So, do you collect anything? I actually collect photo cards, you know, like when you buy an album, there are either one or two photo cards, and I really like those exclusive photo cards, so that's actually one of my hobbies. Okay, and are there any things that you keep from your childhood? Oh, yes, I still have my doll that I got from my eighth birthday, so now I am 21 years old, so the doll is now 13 years old, so it's quite old, but I actually went to a doll doctor once, like two years ago, it's actually near here, in Shindong Station, so they have a doll doctor for animal dolls, so my doll is a bear, so I got it totally fixed, so it's like almost good as new now. Great, and what are some common things that people usually collect? One of my friends collect books, and I think actually that's very common thing to collect, maybe like comic books, or series of books like Twilight or like Harry Potter. Okay, now we're going to talk about money, so do you prefer to save money or spend money? I prefer to save money, so I try to save money as much as I can, I usually save money for a six-month plan, because every six months I usually go on a trip, and while going on a trip, I kind of like spend most of the money that I save, so in those six months I try to save as much as I can. And how do you save money? I have this account only for saving, the money never comes out unless I go on a trip, so I have that account, so when I get my monthly paycheck from where I work, I put about 80% of the whole money in that account, and I only spend the 20 left over, and when I get some little amount of money from my grandparents or my parents or any other relatives, I also collect that money and I put it at that account. And do you usually use a card or cash? I usually use card, but in winter season I carry a little amount of cash, maybe like 5,000 won or so, because at winter there are lots of winter-only foods such as bungeoppang or hotteok, and I really love those stuff, and those people usually only get cash only, so I try to carry some money around those times.
Part 2 (student answering the 2nd part open question): 
So, I found the wallet near Kyungbokgung. It was about two years ago. I found it near a bench in front of Kyungbokgung and when I found it, I asked my friend if we should take it to a near police station. But we were really worried because right before going to Kyungbokgung, we saw a news about lost and found items fraud because in the news, someone, like, picked a wallet that someone just, like, put somewhere and there were, like, drugs in it. And the person who collected the wallet got into a serious problem, so we were worried we might go through similar stuff. So, we discussed what we should do about the wallet, but we decided to take it because the wallet seemed really fine and it was not a fabric wallet, it was one of those see-through wallets, you know, like, very clear with, like, made out of rubber. We thought it would be just safe to, like, take it and put it at the police station. So, yeah, that's exactly what we did. Okay. Very nice. That's a minute and 20 seconds total. Alright. Okay, so how did you feel about this situation? I was thinking about the person who lost the wallet because inside that wallet, we were able to see-through the wallet, right? So, we were able to see about 10,000 won, and that's quite a lot, right? So, if I ever lost 10,000 won, I would be, like, so frustrated. So, I really wanted to, like, give it to the right person. And one more thing was I was worried if there might be drugs in it.
Part 3 (student and teacher's dialogue): 
What kind of people tend to lose things more often than others? In my opinion, I think people who carry small bags tend to lose stuff more than people who carry big bags, because when people have small bags, they have to put their stuff in their safe to put, because some pockets have zippers, but usually they don't, so when they run or, like, walk really fast, the thing that they put in could, like, easily fall out, but when people carry really big bags, like the bag I actually carry today, they can, like, put it wherever in that one big bag, so it's, like, very unlikely to lose something. And what's the first thing that people should do if they realize they have lost something? I guess it depends on what that item is. If it is an electrical device, such as, maybe an iPad or iPhone, you could check it on Google or other iPhone-related apps, so that's how they can easily find their electrical item, but if it's not an electrical item, or if they have never put those Apple tags on that item, then I think they should ask their companion who, like, went through the day with, because they might be able to remember where they put it, so I think that could be one nice way to find what they lost. And how can people, like, prevent losing things? I think labeling stuff is one nice way. I have, like, pouches for each stuff, and on that pouch I have, like, labeled stuff, like, for, like, one example, chargers. In that pouch I have a phone charger and iPad charger and heater charger for, like, winter season, and another labeled pouch is, like, for makeups. I have, like, my cosmetics in there and also my hand sanitizer. And, yeah, that really makes me help not to lose stuff. Yes? And why do some people find their lost items more easily than other people? I guess some people does have really nice memories, and I guess some people have track of stuff they carry around, so people with good memories, maybe, or like I said before, a companion might remember where I put my stuff, so people who go through the day with many people might be easily find their lost items. Right. And why do you think some people just walk by a lost item and not pick it up? Well, like I said before, there are news about the dangers of picking up lost items, so they might actually saw the same news and decide not to just pick it because it could be dangerous. There could be, like, drugs or, like, they could get into a serious crime by just picking up a lost item just to prevent crimes. And do you think there is any difference between losing something in an urban area and losing something in a rural area? It depends on where you live. So if the rural area is, like, the place you actually live in, then you'll, like, really get to know all where is where. And in rural area, it could be just my thoughts, but people are really, like, really close to each other because, like, there are not many people living in that area, so people could, like, easily know which stuff belongs to whom and that could really help someone find their lost items. But if someone is not a person from that rural area, I think that will be, like, really hard to find their lost item because not many people would be eager to find that someone's lost item, and it's really hard to find direction in rural places. So, yeah, but if the person is someone from an urban area, then it'll be just same as the person who lives in rural area. They could easily find stuff. Okay.

Part 2 (student answering the 2nd part open question): 
One of the inventions that I like to often use is a cooking gadget for avocados. And what it can do is, it looks like a, like a round blade, like a plastic blade that can, that kind of cuts through the avocado and then makes it... And it was pretty popular, like it was viral on, like all platforms or social media. And it's pretty much straightforward because you just cut into the, cut through the avocado and then take the pit out. And it's pretty easy to use, and the reason it is useful is that it takes, it reduces the time of like, you know, peeling the avocados and so it's easier for people to just access it right away. I think that's it for now.
Part 3 (student and teacher's dialogue): 
What qualities do inventors have? I think inventors need to have a lot of creative thinking, obviously, because, ummm... In order to, like, invent things, and then they need to access... They need to approach things, problem solving strategies in a... In like a creative way, so I think... Thinking of things in like a different perspective, different lens is important. Do you think only scientists can invent new things? Not necessarily. It can be anyone, or maybe like, whether that would be like a homemaker, like a stay-at-home mom, for example, that can create certain kitchen tools. What inventions do you think should be improved? I guess in terms of... I think, ummm... Maybe the cost of... The financial cost and the accessibility from that perspective, it can be improved. And, yes, that's it. Are there any other inventions that make the world better? I think in terms of, for example, education, there are certain online applications that make education more widely accessible and for people of all ages can learn things in a new, creative way. Like Duolingo or other language-related apps. So I think, yeah, that's one of the easiest examples that I could think of. Do all inventions bring benefits to our world? Most of the time it's mostly positive, but sometimes it can... Not fully effective, and it can be sometimes negative. Who should support or sponsor inventors, governments or private companies? I think both. From the government side, they can foster regulations or new laws related to scientific inventions. And private companies can sponsor or... Become catalysts in promoting scientific inventions.

I think in terms of, for example, education, there are certain online applications that make education more widely accessible and for people of all ages can learn things in a new, creative way.

Most of the time it's mostly positive, but sometimes it can... Not fully effective, and it can be sometimes negative. Who should support or sponsor inventors, governments or private companies?

Yeah, exactly. For every celebration I try to bake cake. For my mom's birthday, my dad's birthday. Thank you very much.",125.0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECUmZ_NQZpM,"First, I want to start with the first criteria, which is your fluency and coherence. As you know, there are four criteria in IELTS speaking. The first one is your fluency and coherence. To start with that, I can say that one of the strongest points that you have in your speaking is your fluency. You have the flow of speech, you are confident and you're able to just keep talking, and to talk about different topics, the familiar ones and unfamiliar ones. So, this is very important, and you're not struggling to come up with ideas. Other than that, another good thing in your speaking is that you don't have many pauses or hesitations. Like, whenever you feel like you will have some pauses, or you don't know what else to say, you just keep talking about other topics. Maybe you go off topic, or you use some fillers and boosters to fill up those gaps, which is a very good thing. However, you had some self-repetition and self-correction. Like, you kept repeating the same phrases or the same words, for example, convey the meaning. You repeated that three times. And correcting grammar points, for example, you were encouraged. And I will tell you what to do about that, because the mistakes that you made are not actually showing the problem with your grammar. Because you have a good command of English. The thing is that you speak very fast. But we will get there. I will tell you more about that. So, you have the flow of a speech, and you have just a few self-repetitions and self-corrections. It is always a good idea to correct yourself. Like, when you make a mistake, just try to correct yourself. Because this way, you are just using the precise thing or the correct thing that you should. However, you can just paraphrase some words. Because the problem was that you were repeating the same words or the same collocations. So, try to use more synonyms. And if you don't know what to say, because sometimes you may face some unfamiliar topics. Or it's fine, but you don't have collocations about that. Or you don't have any idea to develop. So, in that case, try to just fake the topic. Or you can just lie. Yeah, exactly. Be a liar. As long as your answer is related to the question, you are good to go. It's fine. So, for example, I ask you to talk about your experience with something. For example, your experience in an art gallery. Maybe you have never been to an art gallery. But you can talk about your friend's experience in an art gallery. So, just keep talking. And this way, you can just link the topic, the given topic, to a topic that you are better at. Or you have better vocabulary. This can help you with your self-repetition and self-correction. Another thing that can help you is to just... Maybe you need to slow down a bit. Because you were speaking so fast, as you wanted to give me all the information, all the ideas that you have in mind. I agree with you. So, you can just avoid these self-repetitions by slowing down and sometimes changing your pace. Like you raise your voice, you lower your voice. And when you want to think about what you want to just keep saying, you can just slow down. And then you go back to your normal pace. It's fine. No problem with that. The only problem that you have, like... So far, everything was good. You just had these self-repetitions and self-corrections. But the problem that you had is that you did not use a wide range of connectives and discourse markers. I really wanted to give you a seven in your fluency and coherence. But you got a six. And the reason is only... One of the reasons is because of the range of connectives that you didn't have. You should remember that even if you're using a range of complex structures, which is really good and can mark you up in your grammatical range and accuracy, which is another criteria, if you don't use good connectives and discourse markers, you cannot get a higher score. Like, not more than a five or six. Yeah. So, as you were just using and, so, but, because. These four simple connectives and you did not use more, you couldn't get a seven. But you can easily get a seven, just by working a bit on your connectives. And I'm sure that you know how to use them. Just try to use them naturally in your sentences. For example, instead of and, you can use besides, moreover, in addition to that. Other than that. Exactly. Or instead of but, you can use however. Instead of because, you can use as or since. Exactly. So, try to use more connectives because it can also help you with your grammatical range and accuracy. Thank you. The last thing to mention regarding your fluency and coherence is that you should be a bit more careful with the question that you're asked. In the first part, the first topic was about your work, but you explained a bit about, exactly, you talked about your hometown or where you live. And especially in the first question. In the second and third one, you just explained a bit about your job, but then you went off topic, talking about your hometown, which was totally irrelevant to the question. So, try to give a very exact, related answer to the question. This is very important. And in the first part, yes, you should always explain. Because you ask me should I explain now when I was asking you about the cake, I guess. So, always provide explanation in the first part. Like, two, three sentences you should give the answer to the questions. The answer, explanation and example. But it shouldn't be very long. Now, to talk about the next criteria which is your lexical resource, your vocabulary. In your vocabulary, I can say that, as I mentioned, it is really good that you can talk about the topics as length, familiar ones or unfamiliar ones. And you use some very good collocations. To mention some, for example, you said you should follow your dreams, or the rush hour, or a city is overpopulated. And good vocabulary, for example, classical music to boost your mind or the function of your mind. Exactly. So, this is very good concerning your collocations. You can still use more collocations if you can, just by going off topic or talking about or using the collocations in another topic, a topic that you are better at. So this is about the collocations, but in order to get a higher score, you just need to use more idiomatic language because this is necessary if you want to get 7 and above in your vocabulary. So, more idiomatic language and paraphrasing. Your paraphrasing is generally fine, but again, if you want to get a higher score, you need to paraphrase successfully, especially when the examiner asks you a question. You shouldn't repeat what you hear in the question. So, just use some direct synonyms. And remember, only direct synonyms, because being error-free is more important than using some words that you are not 100% sure about. So, you have good paraphrasing, you have good collocations, but you still need to give a wider range to that. And you were using good fillers and boosters. Just by slowing down, you can use more fillers and boosters. Because it can help you to buy yourself more time and then keep talking with better ideas. So, because of all that, you got another 6 in your lexical resource. As I said, you can get a 7. You need more collocations, more idiomatic language, and a better paraphrasing. Now, to talk about the next criteria, which is your grammatical range and accuracy. I can say that your grammar is, again, one of your strongest points. Just like your fluency. Because you were able to use a range of complex structures. I could hear very good tenses, and more importantly, correct tenses, like present perfect continuous, past perfect, or present perfect. And other than that, some complex structures, for example, conditional sentences, or relative clauses, or subordinate clauses, or compound sentences. But if you use more connectives, you can make more complex structures. This can also help you in this criteria. So, generally, it was really good how you used the complex structures. If you can give a wider range to that, or if you can use more connectives, then you can get a higher score in your grammar as well, because you have a very good control over that. Thank you so much. Regarding your mistakes, you made some mistakes. Like, most of your sentences were error free, and this is really good. And as you were speaking so fast that you could manage this part, this shows that you have a very good command of English. But the only mistakes that you made were mostly because of your fast pace. So, just slow down. It's a problem in my life. So, for example, watching movie, you should have said, watching movies. Or, I have eight month daughter. And, the article. Or, some peoples, some people. Among of, no, among the people. Good at in, no, you're good at something. Or, too many, no, you should have said so many people, because too many has a negative meaning, and you didn't want to refer to that. So, you just added some words that you shouldn't have, or you had problems with singular and plural. So, slow down and be careful with your mistakes. And, mostly, people, like, candidates, make more mistakes in the second part, compared to the first or the third part. Especially with the tenses, because you're literally telling a story, and you should switch from one tense to another, so you make more mistakes with that. Be careful with it. So, because of all that, you got a 7 in your grammatical range and accuracy. But you can mark up. You can get a higher score. Just give a wider range to your complex structures. Okay. And, finally, to talk about your pronunciation, in that, you got another 7, because you are able to... Your speaking is totally easy and clear to understand. And you didn't have many mispronunciations. It was just a few. For example, the word particular. And you failed to use some pronunciation features, like word stress or sentence stress, only because of your fast pace. Because, in this criteria, your intonation, your rhythm also matters. So, if you just slow down, you can maintain a better intonation. Right. So, just to wrap up, in your fluency, you got a 6. You can just use more connectives, and be careful with the question that you're asked. In your vocabulary, you got another 6. You need to use more idiomatic language, and you should have a better paraphrasing. In your grammar, you got a 7. You can easily get a higher score. And in your pronunciation, another 7. That would bring you an overall score of 6.5. But, as I just mentioned several times, you can easily get a higher score. It's just a matter of practice and time. And you can do it in a short time. Just try to focus on the problems and the weak points that you have. And you can do that. Why not? So, do you have any questions or problems?",683.0,6.5,6.0,6.0,7.0,0.4071661237785016,"Describe talent you have and want to improve. You should say:

Part 2 (student answering the 2nd part open question): 
Thank you so much. So, you know I've been teaching English for about 10 years, and I think one of the talents that I have in my life is teaching English and conveying meaning and encouraging my students to improve their knowledge in English. So, in my own idea, I think my talent is teaching English to my students, and yeah, I trained myself many, many years ago. I took IELTS test in 2009 and at that time, as I remember, I learned, I had learned English for about 12 years. Because many years ago, when the students wanted to learn English, it was too long, you know, but not like today, because after 6 or 7 years these days, you can get your IELTS degree and be professional in it. Yeah, I want to improve it. Because of this, I'm here, I want to test my knowledge. Where am I exactly? So, if it's necessary, I think I can improve my knowledge too. It benefits me, because I think the first point that I travel to other country, I can communicate with other people easily, and I can understand them. It's one of the most important things in my life. And watching movie. When I watch movie, I can understand, not 100% of the speech, but I can understand the whole meaning of their speech. And I think maybe for my little daughter is good, because I have 8-month daughter, so maybe she's proud of me when she brought up, when she will bring up and she says my mom is a teacher and I have no problem about any problems in my life. So, I think it has more benefits than this. And, you know, everyone has... Thank you very much. Your time is over.
Part 3 (student and teacher's dialogue): 
Do you think that talented people are happy people as well? Talented people are happy as well? No, I don't think so. Because maybe some people that are talented are not good at, are not good at in their fields, but maybe some people are not talented and do their best, and do their best in their lives. And, you know, I think you mean that being famous in this situation, maybe some talented people are not famous and are not popular, so they have to present themselves among of people to show that they have particular talent, and people encourage them to get them improved. And how about the difference between talent and skill? Skill, yeah, talent is natural. It's natural ability, I think. Maybe you were born with it, but skills you can gain during your life, and you can gain it with some intensive courses, some majors, maybe academic courses, or so on. Okay, and what are the talents that you have that are proud of? I'm proud of myself. Come on, you know, all my students love me because I have a good relationship with them when I teach them. So, as they said, and as I know, I think conveying meaning and transferring my knowledge to my students is one of my talents that I have because, you know, art of teaching is the most important point in teaching English. And maybe I have high confidence, but I have it. And has this talent helped you in your life, in your own life? Yeah, yeah, in my own life because at that time my husband encouraged, my husband was encouraged to study his lesson and continue his education in English. So maybe I had a positive point on him. Okay, and do you think that having this talent is important for an individual, or people can have different talents? Could you please explain it again, or repeat it again? Having your talent, like being a teacher, do you think it's important for an individual, for every person, or people can have different talents, other talents? Oh, you mean... Other than teaching. Oh, you mean except these talents? Okay, except these... I don't think so. I don't have any talents. Because all my life is teaching and all the time I prefer to connect something to my major, to my talents. So I haven't had anything to talk about it, about my talents. Okay, and how about other countries? Do you think that there is a talent or a skill that people shouldn't necessarily have them? Yeah, why not? You mean according to my teaching, or no, the other talents? Can you explain more about other talents? Everyone has particular talents in their lives, according to their fields, according to their life. So it's necessary to be talented in your life, if you want to follow your dreams, if you want to follow the field that you want to do in the future. Yeah, in other countries we have too many talented people. Okay, thank you very much. You're welcome.

In the first part, the first topic was about your work, but you explained a bit about, exactly, you talked about your hometown or where you live. And especially in the first question. In the second and third one, you just explained a bit about your job, but then you went off topic, talking about your hometown, which was totally irrelevant to the question. So, try to give a very exact, related answer to the question. This is very important. And in the first part, yes, you should always explain. Because you ask me should I explain now when I was asking you about the cake, I guess. So, always provide explanation in the first part. Like, two, three sentences you should give the answer to the questions. The answer, explanation and example. But it shouldn't be very long. Now, to talk about the next criteria which is your lexical resource, your vocabulary. In your vocabulary, I can say that, as I mentioned, it is really good that you can talk about the topics as length, familiar ones or unfamiliar ones. And you use some very good collocations. To mention some, for example, you said you should follow your dreams, or the rush hour, or a city is overpopulated. And good vocabulary, for example, classical music to boost your mind or the function of your mind. Exactly. So, this is very good concerning your collocations. You can still use more collocations if you can, just by going off topic or talking about or using the collocations in another topic, a topic that you are better at. So this is about the collocations, but in order to get a higher score, you just need to use more idiomatic language because this is necessary if you want to get 7 and above in your vocabulary. So, more idiomatic language and paraphrasing. Your paraphrasing is generally fine, but again, if you want to get a higher score, you need to paraphrase successfully, especially when the examiner asks you a question. You shouldn't repeat what you hear in the question. So, just use some direct synonyms. And remember, only direct synonyms, because being error-free is more important than using some words that you are not 100% sure about. So, you have good paraphrasing, you have good collocations, but you still need to give a wider range to that. And you were using good fillers and boosters. Just by slowing down, you can use more fillers and boosters. Because it can help you to buy yourself more time and then keep talking with better ideas. So, because of all that, you got another 6 in your lexical resource. As I said, you can get a 7. You need more collocations, more idiomatic language, and a better paraphrasing. Now, to talk about the next criteria, which is your grammatical range and accuracy. I can say that your grammar is, again, one of your strongest points. Just like your fluency. Because you were able to use a range of complex structures. I could hear very good tenses, and more importantly, correct tenses, like present perfect continuous, past perfect, or present perfect. And other than that, some complex structures, for example, conditional sentences, or relative clauses, or subordinate clauses, or compound sentences. But if you use more connectives, you can make more complex structures. This can also help you in this criteria. So, generally, it was really good how you used the complex structures. If you can give a wider range to that, or if you can use more connectives, then you can get a higher score in your grammar as well, because you have a very good control over that. Thank you so much. Regarding your mistakes, you made some mistakes. Like, most of your sentences were error free, and this is really good. And as you were speaking so fast that you could manage this part, this shows that you have a very good command of English. But the only mistakes that you made were mostly because of your fast pace. So, just slow down. It's a problem in my life. So, for example, watching movie, you should have said, watching movies. Or, I have eight month daughter. And, the article. Or, some peoples, some people. Among of, no, among the people. Good at in, no, you're good at something. Or, too many, no, you should have said so many people, because too many has a negative meaning, and you didn't want to refer to that. So, you just added some words that you shouldn't have, or you had problems with singular and plural. So, slow down and be careful with your mistakes. And, mostly, people, like, candidates, make more mistakes in the second part, compared to the first or the third part. Especially with the tenses, because you're literally telling a story, and you should switch from one tense to another, so you make more mistakes with that. Be careful with it. So, because of all that, you got a 7 in your grammatical range and accuracy. But you can mark up. You can get a higher score. Just give a wider range to your complex structures. Okay. And, finally, to talk about your pronunciation, in that, you got another 7, because you are able to... Your speaking is totally easy and clear to understand. And you didn't have many mispronunciations. It was just a few. For example, the word particular. And you failed to use some pronunciation features, like word stress or sentence stress, only because of your fast pace. Because, in this criteria, your intonation, your rhythm also matters. So, if you just slow down, you can maintain a better intonation. Right. So, just to wrap up, in your fluency, you got a 6. You can just use more connectives, and be careful with the question that you're asked. In your vocabulary, you got another 6. You need to use more idiomatic language, and you should have a better paraphrasing. In your grammar, you got a 7. You can easily get a higher score. And in your pronunciation, another 7. That would bring you an overall score of 6.5. But, as I just mentioned several times, you can easily get a higher score. It's just a matter of practice and time. And you can do it in a short time. Just try to focus on the problems and the weak points that you have. And you can do that. Why not? So, do you have any questions or problems?",683.0,6.5,6.0,6.0,7.0,0.4080267558528428,"Describe talent you have and want to improve. You should say:

Because maybe some people that are talented are not good at, are not good at in their fields, but maybe some people are not talented and do their best, and do their best in their lives. And, you know, I think you mean that being famous in this situation, maybe some talented people are not famous and are not popular, so they have to present themselves among of people to show that they have particular talent, and people encourage them to get them improved. And how about the difference between talent and skill? Skill, yeah, talent is natural. It's natural ability, I think. Maybe you were born with it, but skills you can gain during your life, and you can gain it with some intensive courses, some majors, maybe academic courses, or so on. Okay, and what are the talents that you have that are proud of? I'm proud of myself. Come on, you know, all my students love me because I have a good relationship with them when I teach them. So, as they said, and as I know, I think conveying meaning and transferring my knowledge to my students is one of my talents that I have because, you know, art of teaching is the most important point in teaching English. And maybe I have high confidence, but I have it. And has this talent helped you in your life, in your own life? Yeah, yeah, in my own life because at that time my husband encouraged, my husband was encouraged to study his lesson and continue his education in English. So maybe I had a positive point on him. Okay, and do you think that having this talent is important for an individual, or people can have different talents? Could you please explain it again, or repeat it again? Having your talent, like being a teacher, do you think it's important for an individual, for every person, or people can have different talents, other talents? Oh, you mean... Other than teaching. Oh, you mean except these talents? Okay, except these... I don't think so. I don't have any talents. Because all my life is teaching and all the time I prefer to connect something to my major, to my talents. So I haven't had anything to talk about it, about my talents. Okay, and how about other countries? Do you think that there is a talent or a skill that people shouldn't necessarily have them? Yeah, why not? You mean according to my teaching, or no, the other talents? Can you explain more about other talents? Everyone has particular talents in their lives, according to their fields, according to their life. So it's necessary to be talented in your life, if you want to follow your dreams, if you want to follow the field that you want to do in the future. Yeah, in other countries we have too many talented people. Okay, thank you very much. You're welcome.",214.0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECUmZ_NQZpM,"First, I want to start with the first criteria, which is your fluency and coherence. As you know, there are four criteria in IELTS speaking. The first one is your fluency and coherence. To start with that, I can say that one of the strongest points that you have in your speaking is your fluency. You have the flow of speech, you are confident and you're able to just keep talking, and to talk about different topics, the familiar ones and unfamiliar ones. So, this is very important, and you're not struggling to come up with ideas. Other than that, another good thing in your speaking is that you don't have many pauses or hesitations. Like, whenever you feel like you will have some pauses, or you don't know what else to say, you just keep talking about other topics. Maybe you go off topic, or you use some fillers and boosters to fill up those gaps, which is a very good thing. However, you had some self-repetition and self-correction. Like, you kept repeating the same phrases or the same words, for example, convey the meaning. You repeated that three times. And correcting grammar points, for example, you were encouraged. And I will tell you what to do about that, because the mistakes that you made are not actually showing the problem with your grammar. Because you have a good command of English. The thing is that you speak very fast. But we will get there. I will tell you more about that. So, you have the flow of a speech, and you have just a few self-repetitions and self-corrections. It is always a good idea to correct yourself. Like, when you make a mistake, just try to correct yourself. Because this way, you are just using the precise thing or the correct thing that you should. However, you can just paraphrase some words. Because the problem was that you were repeating the same words or the same collocations. So, try to use more synonyms. And if you don't know what to say, because sometimes you may face some unfamiliar topics. Or it's fine, but you don't have collocations about that. Or you don't have any idea to develop. So, in that case, try to just fake the topic. Or you can just lie. Yeah, exactly. Be a liar. As long as your answer is related to the question, you are good to go. It's fine. So, for example, I ask you to talk about your experience with something. For example, your experience in an art gallery. Maybe you have never been to an art gallery. But you can talk about your friend's experience in an art gallery. So, just keep talking. And this way, you can just link the topic, the given topic, to a topic that you are better at. Or you have better vocabulary. This can help you with your self-repetition and self-correction. Another thing that can help you is to just... Maybe you need to slow down a bit. Because you were speaking so fast, as you wanted to give me all the information, all the ideas that you have in mind. I agree with you. So, you can just avoid these self-repetitions by slowing down and sometimes changing your pace. Like you raise your voice, you lower your voice. And when you want to think about what you want to just keep saying, you can just slow down. And then you go back to your normal pace. It's fine. No problem with that. The only problem that you have, like... So far, everything was good. You just had these self-repetitions and self-corrections. But the problem that you had is that you did not use a wide range of connectives and discourse markers. I really wanted to give you a seven in your fluency and coherence. But you got a six. And the reason is only... One of the reasons is because of the range of connectives that you didn't have. You should remember that even if you're using a range of complex structures, which is really good and can mark you up in your grammatical range and accuracy, which is another criteria, if you don't use good connectives and discourse markers, you cannot get a higher score. Like, not more than a five or six. Yeah. So, as you were just using and, so, but, because. These four simple connectives and you did not use more, you couldn't get a seven. But you can easily get a seven, just by working a bit on your connectives. And I'm sure that you know how to use them. Just try to use them naturally in your sentences. For example, instead of and, you can use besides, moreover, in addition to that. Other than that. Exactly. Or instead of but, you can use however. Instead of because, you can use as or since. Exactly. So, try to use more connectives because it can also help you with your grammatical range and accuracy. Thank you. The last thing to mention regarding your fluency and coherence is that you should be a bit more careful with the question that you're asked. In the first part, the first topic was about your work, but you explained a bit about, exactly, you talked about your hometown or where you live. And especially in the first question. In the second and third one, you just explained a bit about your job, but then you went off topic, talking about your hometown, which was totally irrelevant to the question. So, try to give a very exact, related answer to the question. This is very important. And in the first part, yes, you should always explain. Because you ask me should I explain now when I was asking you about the cake, I guess. So, always provide explanation in the first part. Like, two, three sentences you should give the answer to the questions. The answer, explanation and example. But it shouldn't be very long. Now, to talk about the next criteria which is your lexical resource, your vocabulary. In your vocabulary, I can say that, as I mentioned, it is really good that you can talk about the topics as length, familiar ones or unfamiliar ones. And you use some very good collocations. To mention some, for example, you said you should follow your dreams, or the rush hour, or a city is overpopulated. And good vocabulary, for example, classical music to boost your mind or the function of your mind. Exactly. So, this is very good concerning your collocations. You can still use more collocations if you can, just by going off topic or talking about or using the collocations in another topic, a topic that you are better at. So this is about the collocations, but in order to get a higher score, you just need to use more idiomatic language because this is necessary if you want to get 7 and above in your vocabulary. So, more idiomatic language and paraphrasing. Your paraphrasing is generally fine, but again, if you want to get a higher score, you need to paraphrase successfully, especially when the examiner asks you a question. You shouldn't repeat what you hear in the question. So, just use some direct synonyms. And remember, only direct synonyms, because being error-free is more important than using some words that you are not 100% sure about. So, you have good paraphrasing, you have good collocations, but you still need to give a wider range to that. And you were using good fillers and boosters. Just by slowing down, you can use more fillers and boosters. Because it can help you to buy yourself more time and then keep talking with better ideas. So, because of all that, you got another 6 in your lexical resource. As I said, you can get a 7. You need more collocations, more idiomatic language, and a better paraphrasing. Now, to talk about the next criteria, which is your grammatical range and accuracy. I can say that your grammar is, again, one of your strongest points. Just like your fluency.

And other than that, some complex structures, for example, conditional sentences, or relative clauses, or subordinate clauses, or compound sentences. But if you use more connectives, you can make more complex structures. This can also help you in this criteria. So, generally, it was really good how you used the complex structures. If you can give a wider range to that, or if you can use more connectives, then you can get a higher score in your grammar as well, because you have a very good control over that. Thank you so much. Regarding your mistakes, you made some mistakes. Like, most of your sentences were error free, and this is really good. And as you were speaking so fast that you could manage this part, this shows that you have a very good command of English. But the only mistakes that you made were mostly because of your fast pace.

So, because of all that, you got a 7 in your grammatical range and accuracy. But you can mark up. You can get a higher score. Just give a wider range to your complex structures. Okay. And, finally, to talk about your pronunciation, in that, you got another 7, because you are able to... Your speaking is totally easy and clear to understand.

Now, we can review how you did in your speaking test. And as you may also know, there are four major criteria for assessing and evaluating your speaking performance. Fluency and coherence is the first one, lexical resource, grammatical range and accuracy, and pronunciation. Let's start with fluency and coherence. Well, of course, you really like to speak at length. You try to maintain the flow of speech, but I think your nervousness blocked your capability to move ahead and go ahead with your speaking. It's very important to have a management over your stress and nervousness. This is first of all. And, second, you need to use more... a wider variety of connectives, because you just used and, so, but in order to connect and link different sentences to each other. Try to use a wider variety of connectives like however, even though, and since those connectives that make your sentences diverse and gives this impression that you are able to speak at length. So, try to use them, diversify the connectives, and also you need to try boosters before starting to give the answer. You have to use those boosters, like, in my opinion, or that's a difficult question, let me think about it. And all of those are boosters and you also can use fillers when you're not certain what to say, you can use, you know, or sort of, or I think, I believe. All of those phrases can help you buy some time to provide an accurate answer to the question. So, try to use them in order to increase your band score. So, when it comes to lexical resource or vocabulary, you did have... you managed to talk about the answers and back up your answers using examples. You failed. You did fail to provide detailed answers to the question because of your, perhaps, weak vocabulary treasure. Try to increase your diversity of vocabulary. Try to use a wider range of vocabulary, and plus, you need to paraphrase. You need to rephrase the question of the examiner before starting to answer. I say, for example, tell me about the advantages and disadvantages of sunglasses, for example. You should say, the pros and cons of sunglasses. Yes, I want to tell you, for example. So, rephrase the question and then begin with the answer. It's very important. And you did have a couple of mistakes in the vocabulary section. For example, you said, it depends on... it depends to, not on. You need to pay closer attention. Of course, this is also... this has to do with the grammatical range and accuracy, but you need to pay attention to prepositions as well. And you said, they are truth to me. You were talking about your friends and you said, they are truth to me, they are honest with me. You know what I'm talking about? So, you have to pay closer attention to those subtle issues in order to increase your band score and enhance the level of your performance. So, let's go to grammatical range and accuracy. So, in this part, you faced some difficulties when it comes to using compound structures and complex structures. You did not use conditional sentences, subordinate clauses, relative clauses. You only used simple forms of the sentences. And so, you need to use complicated and more complex structures in order to increase your And you made a couple of mistakes here in the grammatical section. You were talking about the past and you said, we want to travel, you have to add ed, we wanted to travel, when you're talking about a past event. A person who take, a person who takes. To tell the truth, you said, to telling the truth. And those mistakes, of course, will mark you down. Pay attention. Be careful with those mistakes. Try to hone them and try to fix them in order to get a higher band score. So, and when it comes to pronunciation, you were okay in terms of pronunciation, you are clear, but in some instances and some occasions, you mispronounced, for example, the sound B. Try to say the sound and utter the exact same sound that you use. You said, probe hearts. And I think you should have said, broke our hearts. You said probe. I did not really understand and sometimes it damages clarity. You have to be careful how to pronounce those sounds and words. Wish you all the best. So your final band score would be four. And you have to pay attention to what I said today. And bear in mind the tips and you will definitely increase your band score next time.

Part 2 (student answering the 2nd part open question): 
Okay, I want to talk about a lie. It was 8 months ago. And when I want to travel to my hometown, I was lying to my friends. For example, they told me, Could you hang out with us? I said, no I can't. I couldn't. Because I don't like to hang out with them. And just, I wanted to watch movie in my home. And then, tomorrow, at that time, I wanted to travel to my hometown. And I felt...

The real lie... Well, you have to answer the question. In fact, I think always tell the truth can help us to solve our problems. And, as I told you, when we are, for example, in the dangerous situation and we forced to tell lie, we can tell lie to others. Do you think we can lie to our friends and family? Ummm... Not actually. I always tell the truth to my family or friend, but it depends that situation. It depends on every situation. And, do you find it acceptable to lie about your feelings to someone because you don't want to hurt them? Ummm... I think it's not a... It is a bad... It is the worst things in the world to lie to friends or someone can, for example, broke their heart. And, for example, they think about us as a bad person. And, has anybody ever lied to you about their real identity? Ummm... Real... Has anybody ever lied to you about your, about their real identity, excuse me? Real identity? Ummm... I can't understand the meaning of the question. I know what you say, but, for example, their real... Has anybody ever lied to you about their real identity? That's the question. Okay. Ummm... I think I don't like... I don't like somebody are reliable to everyone. I prefer to make a friendship with everyone can be a truth, for example, truth person.

And as you may also know, there are four major criteria for assessing and evaluating your speaking performance. Fluency and coherence is the first one, lexical resource, grammatical range and accuracy, and pronunciation. Let's start with fluency and coherence. Well, of course, you really like to speak at length. You try to maintain the flow of speech, but I think your nervousness blocked your capability to move ahead and go ahead with your speaking. It's very important to have a management over your stress and nervousness. This is first of all. And, second, you need to use more... a wider variety of connectives, because you just used and, so, but in order to connect and link different sentences to each other. Try to use a wider variety of connectives like however, even though, and since those connectives that make your sentences diverse and gives this impression that you are able to speak at length. So, try to use them, diversify the connectives, and also you need to try boosters before starting to give the answer. You have to use those boosters, like, in my opinion, or that's a difficult question, let me think about it. And all of those are boosters and you also can use fillers when you're not certain what to say, you can use, you know, or sort of, or I think, I believe. All of those phrases can help you buy some time to provide an accurate answer to the question. So, try to use them in order to increase your band score. So, when it comes to lexical resource or vocabulary, you did have... you managed to talk about the answers and back up your answers using examples. You failed. You did fail to provide detailed answers to the question because of your, perhaps, weak vocabulary treasure. Try to increase your diversity of vocabulary. Try to use a wider range of vocabulary, and plus, you need to paraphrase. You need to rephrase the question of the examiner before starting to answer. I say, for example, tell me about the advantages and disadvantages of sunglasses, for example. You should say, the pros and cons of sunglasses. Yes, I want to tell you, for example. So, rephrase the question and then begin with the answer. It's very important. And you did have a couple of mistakes in the vocabulary section. For example, you said, it depends on... it depends to, not on. You need to pay closer attention. Of course, this is also... this has to do with the grammatical range and accuracy, but you need to pay attention to prepositions as well. And you said, they are truth to me. You were talking about your friends and you said, they are truth to me, they are honest with me. You know what I'm talking about? So, you have to pay closer attention to those subtle issues in order to increase your band score and enhance the level of your performance. So, let's go to grammatical range and accuracy. So, in this part, you faced some difficulties when it comes to using compound structures and complex structures. You did not use conditional sentences, subordinate clauses, relative clauses. You only used simple forms of the sentences. And so, you need to use complicated and more complex structures in order to increase your And you made a couple of mistakes here in the grammatical section. You were talking about the past and you said, we want to travel, you have to add ed, we wanted to travel, when you're talking about a past event. A person who take, a person who takes. To tell the truth, you said, to telling the truth. And those mistakes, of course, will mark you down. Pay attention. Be careful with those mistakes. Try to hone them and try to fix them in order to get a higher band score. So, and when it comes to pronunciation, you were okay in terms of pronunciation, you are clear, but in some instances and some occasions, you mispronounced, for example, the sound B. Try to say the sound and utter the exact same sound that you use. You said, probe hearts. And I think you should have said, broke our hearts. You said probe. I did not really understand and sometimes it damages clarity. You have to be careful how to pronounce those sounds and words. Wish you all the best. So your final band score would be four.

Part 2 (student answering the 2nd part open question): 
Okay, so, I met Rina in the U.S. during my exchange student's life, and she's from Japan, and we got very, umm... got closer in, during the exchange students, because we don't have any Asian friends a lot in there.

So, what's the influence of social media on friendship? Okay, so I have a lot of friends who is living in abroad, like US or Japan or Taiwan. I met them in the US, and if I don't have any Instagram or some the other SNS, I don't have any way to contact with them or something, so I really feel, oh, thanks God, I have some way to contact them or text them. So, yeah, I think the SNS or something is very... have a good influence to make my friendship. Even I have a lot of Korean friends too, but we don't have any time to meet with them. So, yeah, because we have a lot of things to do or something, so sometimes texting them through the SNS is very helpful to improve our friendship. Ah, okay, that's wonderful.

I think during the students, we have a lot of time to enjoy our life or we have a lot of time just... we have a lot of time to think about the friendship or something, but after a job or career or how can I leave something, so I think that is why people just forget about to text them or something. Yeah, that is... I think that is why people just lose their contact with their friends. Hmm, I see. Do people in your country like to make new friends? It depends on who is he, who is she. So, like, for me, I'm a very extrovert person, so I really like to meet some new people and make some new friends, but some of my friends don't like to make some new friends because they just prefer to spend the time with friends who are very close and feel better.

Um, I think the old friends are more important to the old generation because they don't have any like, SNS or some social media on the smartphone, so they prefer to meet like, old friends and just talk about the old memories or something, but for young generation, we have a lot of ways to meet some new people, so yeah, that is why I think like that.

Okay, great. And are there any types of animals that you think should not be kept as a pet? Hmm, for me, some pets are kind of very toxic or bad for human health, such as cockroaches, something like that, so because they have some viruses, could be viruses, so I don't think people should keep cockroaches as pets.

Part 2 (student answering the 2nd part open question): 
So, I'm gonna describe a wild animal in my country, which is South Korea. So, I think one of the wild animals in South Korea is tigers. It lives, they live at the zoo, sometimes they could be found at the, in the forest, as well. I think whenever people see tigers, they feel scared, or they might think they are dangerous, because they have sharp teeth, and they look kind of scary. And I think tigers are gonna fewer in the future, because this is, this is considered as endangered animal, because tigers are very unique these days, so some bad people try to catch it, and try to make it as their own pet, so that people think that this tiger is very special to them. So, I think tigers would be fewer in the future.
Part 3 (student and teacher's dialogue): 
So, what is the purpose of having zoos? Hmm, I think having, the purpose of having zoos is because I think zoos make people happy because we are humans and humans want to see similar species and at the zoo there are lots but they don't, they don't speak languages but same animals. So, we can still see animals without languages so I think people think that very special thing because we are same animals but they don't use languages, so, that's why. And what is your opinion about animals being kept in zoos? Hmm, for me, I think I feel kind of bad for the animals at the zoo because they don't seem to have freedom, so I prefer to see them in the wild because that makes me feel kind of comfortable because animals should be more having freedom than just being kept, captured at the zoo. Hmm, and how do you think zoos could be improved? Hmm, for me, I think the zoo keepers should make the zoo in the forest, in the wild nature. They normally make the zoo in the city and that could be a kind of, how do I say it, paradox because animals should be living in the wild and nature but they actually live in the city. Yeah, so, if the zoo keeper make the zoo in the nature, then that would be better, I think. Yeah, that would be great, right? And do you think it is important to conserve the world's animal species? Of course, because animal species are a very important part of our system because humans and animals are the same species, kind of. So if there's no animals in the systems, ecosystems, I don't think that's working for the world. So, conserving animals is very important. Hmm, okay, great! And what is your opinion on poaching? Poaching? Can you explain me what poaching is? Oh, sure. So, for example, when people hunt wild animals. Hmm, that's poaching. Yeah, that's poaching. Ah. Usually it's illegal. Hmm. Yeah, I don't agree with poaching because for some people who are normally poaching, I think the purpose is for the money, which is a very bad purpose. I don't think it's good for animals to be used for money or for being famous or something. So, yeah, I don't think that's a good way to make money. Hmm. Okay, and do you think money should be spent on protecting wild animals? Yes, I think so because there are lots of animals who are kind of very looking for help for their feeding or something, their food. So people should help the animals who are looking for their feeding or their food. So people should use money, I think.

Not really, because these days, we have cars and then usually in Seoul, there's a lot of traffic in the road and then there are a lot of people, so that's why I prefer to use my car instead of riding a bike.
Part 2 (student answering the 2nd part open question): 
I want to describe the popular person, umm... about my really close friend, and his name is Hemin Park. He's a really famous baseball player in Korea. And, since I was a baseball player, ummm... for about 14 years, so I had a lot of my baseball... baseball player friends, and then he's one of my best friends. So, umm... he is in Samsung University... I'm sorry about that. Actually, now LG Twins, and then he's a really popular baseball player in Seoul, and actually, in Korea. And he's a center fielder, and then he's a good hitter now. So, umm... the second question, what kind of person he is... Okay, it is... he's a very nice, and then a good patient person, because whenever he practices baseball, he's really good at resolving his pain, and then practice for baseball. So that's why he now became a popular person. And also, he's humble when he practices, and then when he became a baseball player. And usually we meet him once a week, but since these days he's very busy with baseball, so that's why maybe after the Korean season, we will meet maybe once a week or twice a week with drinking or maybe going out somewhere. And... yeah.
Part 3 (student and teacher's dialogue): 
Why are some students popular in school? Because, I think, that's our current education system. In Korean education system, we have to study and we have to improve our score to go to the good university. So, that's why a lot of students have to study and maybe making a lot of friends for their futures, and they have to become a popular person with that reason. Okay, is it important for a teacher to be popular? When I was young, it was, but now I think it has changed because, as you can see in the news, we have some problems in communication with the person and person, especially the parents and the teacher. So, these days, some teachers have decreased the rights to teach students and also work in the school. So, that's why a lot of people don't want to become teachers. Okay, very good. And do you think good teachers are always popular among students? Yeah, I agree. Since good teacher has a good attitude and has a good teaching skills. So, they try a lot of students like good teachers, but it's not 100% because some good teachers doesn't have a good attitude. So, I mean, most of teachers are good and have a good attitude, but not 100% to that every student. Okay, and what are the qualities of being a good teacher? In my opinion, communicating with the parents and also school is a good teacher because a lot of people have good skills to teach a student. But these days, some students, I mean, some teachers, doesn't have a good attitude and also good skills at communicating and also relationship with the students. So, that's why a lot of problems happen these days. Okay, is it easier to become popular nowadays, do you think? You said, is it easier to become popular? Popular nowadays. Hmm, I don't think so. Essentially, our community is very competitive and a lot of people are trying to become popular, but since it's too competitive, so that's why a limited person can become a person in the popular environment, but not everyone can become one. Okay, and why do people want to become popular? I think there are several reasons, but one of the reasons is to make money. Because these days, a lot of people want to make money and they're rich. So, as for me, I'm always trying to become popular to make competition and also money. So, I think most of people are with me.

A few things here, let's just pick out some things here, okay, so when I was early 20s, when you talk about your age group, make sure, say in my, when I was in my early 20s, it was a little, it's a little inconvenience, so make sure inconvenience is the noun, you should say inconvenient, it's a little inconvenient.

Part 2 (student answering the 2nd part open question): 
It was a few days ago. I met my friends. I just met my friends at a cafe. So, they prepared my birthday party. As a surprise. I didn't expect it at all. Because it was March, but my birthday is actually February. So, it's a month later. They prepared the gift and flower. Actually, I can't expect the gift, because it's a meeting for my birthday. But, they prepared the flower for my graduation gift. Because I graduated, as I told you, last February. So, it was really impressive, because normally, in Korea, I don't know, not that much people give flower to each other when it comes to just friends. So, they made, they picked certain color for me, and wrapping very unique, like no other. So, I think I got really impressive feeling at that time.
Part 3 (student and teacher's dialogue): 
Why do friends meet up with each other? Um... Um, I think just, hmm, friends can talk each other very, from very light thing to deep talk, so when you get stressed, we can just stress out and solve the problem with just talking with friends. So, I think that is the best part with meeting friends. And where do friends usually meet in your country? In my country? I think the first meeting place is, like, a subway station. Because that is the exact location that we can make a promise, so I think that is the best place. And if friends are spending time together, which places do they go to? When we meet at first, we go to the restaurant to eat, because we're really sensitive to eating, and then we go to a cafe normally, and just grab some coffee and eat more dessert. Okay, and are there any jobs which deal with unexpected things? Can you say that again? Sure, are there any jobs which deal with something that's unexpected? I will say in the service field, because there are a lot of different demands for the service field, so, for example, I was a server at a restaurant, and of course, there are some kind customers, but there are some people that they demand really unexpected things, so it's really difficult to deal with that kind of people. Sure, yeah. And in your country, what kind of jobs are popular? I would say the public officer, because Korea is really competitive, and people get a high pressure, so the public officer is more kind of stable jobs, so many Korean young people want to be want to live like a stable life, and they want to keep like work-job balance, work-life balance, so I think public officer is the most popular job. And do you think parents influence their kids' decision on what job to take? No, I think it depends on kids' personality, because even though the parents influence their mind or their their like characters to their kids, I think it depends on more like the kids' interest and their their character and personality, so I think that's not that much influence to kids.

Part 2 (student answering the 2nd part open question): 
Umm, I'm going to tell you about the food that I tried for the first time. Umm, I tried a Greek food, and it was 2019, I was in Vancouver. Umm, there are much, a lot of chances to try another country's food. So, umm, that day I decided to go for, umm, Greek restaurant. Umm, and it was, umm, summer, so I need some fresh, like, different kind of food that I never tried. So, umm, I went there with my sister. I entered the restaurant, and we were waiting for the server. But the funniest thing was, the server looks a little bit intoxicated, like, her eyes looks really tired. And then we ordered, umm, what we liked. Then, at first, I was really unfamiliar with Greek food. I didn't really know how to eat it. So, we were, umm, we were trying to ask server how to eat this food to enjoy fully these kind of dishes. So, umm, and then we decided to order another, like, drinks. But it was, umm, really normal drinks that I can have in my daily life, not in, umm, Greek restaurant especially. So, umm, to be honest, umm, the Greek food was good.
Part 3 (student and teacher's dialogue): 
What kinds of foreign food are popular in your country? In my country, the most popular one would be American food, I think, because we consider American food as like hamburgers or pizza. Actually, pizza is from Italian food as far as I know, but definitely, America, like the state, is regarded as one of the biggest consumers for the pizza. So, pizza and hamburger is the most consumed in Korea, especially as a late night meal. Okay, and do you think all age groups enjoy these kinds of food? Umm... I don't think pizza and hamburger, like fast food, is not for the whole age group. It's because it's kind of oily and too cheesy for the older group, because, in my opinion, for the older groups, they are more likely to prefer fresh ones or something easy to digest. Okay, and do you think should teachers or parents teach children how to cook? Definitely yes, it's because children will not live with their parents forever, and then knowing how to cook will help the young age group to be independent and feed themselves in the future. Do you think it's common these days for parents to teach their kids how to cook? Unfortunately, I think it's getting less common to teach how to cook. It's because it's getting busier these days, and then both parents are required to work more, so I think they don't have much time to cook together from the childhood. Okay, and do you think in the future it will continue to be like this, or will it change? Umm... I think it depends on the families. If they put effort to learn how to cook, then have their time with family, that family would teach children how to cook, but on the other end, if some family puts more value to make money or have a busy life, they don't have time to know how to cook. Okay, and why do people like to eat their local food, their traditional food? It's because it is the most familiar food for them, and they won't feel any inconvenience or exotic feeling when they are eating, and I think eating should give the happiest time to people.

Umm, and it was, umm, summer, so I need some fresh, like, different kind of food that I never tried. So, umm, I went there with my sister. I entered the restaurant, and we were waiting for the server. But the funniest thing was, the server looks a little bit intoxicated, like, her eyes looks really tired. And then we ordered, umm, what we liked. Then, at first, I was really unfamiliar with Greek food. I didn't really know how to eat it. So, we were, umm, we were trying to ask server how to eat this food to enjoy fully these kind of dishes. So, umm, and then we decided to order another, like, drinks. But it was, umm, really normal drinks that I can have in my daily life, not in, umm, Greek restaurant especially.

Okay, so, Changwon, where is in the southern part of Korea. So, when we use this clause, we can't say where, we have to say which. We only use where, if there is an action verb in this sense.

3.0,"What kinds of foreign food are popular in your country? In my country, the most popular one would be American food, I think, because we consider American food as like hamburgers or pizza. Actually, pizza is from Italian food as far as I know, but definitely, America, like the state, is regarded as one of the biggest consumers for the pizza. So, pizza and hamburger is the most consumed in Korea, especially as a late night meal. Okay, and do you think all age groups enjoy these kinds of food? Umm... I don't think pizza and hamburger, like fast food, is not for the whole age group. It's because it's kind of oily and too cheesy for the older group, because, in my opinion, for the older groups, they are more likely to prefer fresh ones or something easy to digest. Okay, and do you think should teachers or parents teach children how to cook? Definitely yes, it's because children will not live with their parents forever, and then knowing how to cook will help the young age group to be independent and feed themselves in the future. Do you think it's common these days for parents to teach their kids how to cook? Unfortunately, I think it's getting less common to teach how to cook. It's because it's getting busier these days, and then both parents are required to work more, so I think they don't have much time to cook together from the childhood. Okay, and do you think in the future it will continue to be like this, or will it change? Umm... I think it depends on the families. If they put effort to learn how to cook, then have their time with family, that family would teach children how to cook, but on the other end, if some family puts more value to make money or have a busy life, they don't have time to know how to cook. Okay, and why do people like to eat their local food, their traditional food? It's because it is the most familiar food for them, and they won't feel any inconvenience or exotic feeling when they are eating, and I think eating should give the happiest time to people.",250.0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSoBQSoiIT8,"I'd say your overall score today, the estimate would be a 6.0 today.

I love my job, it was my dream to be an actress, model, and I started in Poland, actually, modeling, as a side job, but when I came to Korea it became my major, which I love. Hmm, nice. Is there anything you dislike about your job? Actually, no, I love everything, because the schedule is not regular. It's not like 9-to-5 job, which also I, like, I don't, I cannot do this 9-to-5 job.

So, could you describe your hometown for me? My hometown. My hometown is pretty cute hometown. It has a castle, and the architecture is pretty much same like in whole Europe, it's really similar to Prague, there's a lot of foreigners there. We have a castle, which all the tourists go. In front of the castle, there is a river, and there is a dragon, it's also like the legendary dragon, and the dragon breathes out the fire every couple of minutes. So, it's very nice tourist attraction. What else? Most of the buildings are very old. We don't like destroy them and don't build new ones to like sustain this kind of very old look, I guess. Okay, nice. So, yeah, we don't have many new buildings. And do you think you will live there in the future? No, I don't think so. I actually like living here in Korea. It's like a totally different world for me actually. People are totally different. The culture is totally different, like the cute culture. You know, they are very welcoming.

Could you tell me about the weather in your hometown? The weather? Actually, it's similar to Korea. It gets very cold, it gets very hot in the summer, but the summer lasts for like three, four weeks.

Like in the morning it can be 5-10 degrees, and during the day 26. So, it's very, very kind of annoying here.

Well, I talked about pierogi before. But any special in my hometown? No, I don't think so. We don't have any special food, we have like classic food, which is in Poland.

Part 2 (student answering the 2nd part open question): 
Okay, this is a very hard question. Like, I really didn't know who to decide. I picked Jim Carrey. Probably you know about him. He's an actor from the U.S. So, he's an inspiration for me, because he followed his dreams. Doesn't matter of the hindrances he had. He was poor growing up, and I remember he was saying, like, he wrote a check for him for 1 million dollars and he And he drives to the hill in his hometown to just imagine, like, that he already achieved what he got. So, it was very inspiring to hear that story. And also, he was a comedian at the first, right? So, he started to be a comedian, because his dad was, I don't know for sure, but I think he was independent. He just wanted to make him laugh. So, it's, like, a very hard story. And, like, also, he had a quote, famous quote. If you can fail at what you don't want to do, you might as well take a chance on doing what you love, right? So, this is, like, very inspiring. That's why I chose Jim Carrey. Yeah. And what he was like before he was famous. Well, I don't really know, because we get to know them when they're famous, right?
Part 3 (student and teacher's dialogue): 
So, what kinds of famous people are there in your country? In my country? Well, I know, actually, Polish people who went to US. For example, from the TV series Supernatural. His name was, I think, Sharon Podoleski. If I'm not wrong. And from Vampire, there is another TV show. Probably you didn't hear about it. It's like, it's a romance. So, it's... his name was John Wesley. So, they are actually 100% Polish. But they just came to US and start acting career. Okay. So, apart from actors, are there any other professions which make people famous in your country? Ah, yeah. There is a soccer player, Lewandowski. He's very famous. I'm sure you heard about him. Of course. So, yeah, he's very famous. And also, not famous people, but famous games. Should I talk about it? More about people. More about people and professions. Okay. So, there's also ski jumper. His name is Adam Malusz. He was very famous when I was a kid. Everyone was watching ski jumping. He was like the gold medalist. It was really amazing to see. And why do you think sports people become famous? Sports people... because they train very hard. So, when they win, people just really appreciate them, admire them. Because they put so much work in training just to win. Or maybe not just win, just they want to do what they love. And this is what they do. They just train so hard. And they win and it's like amazing. Good. And what's the differences between famous people these days and famous people in the past? Social media, more exposure. I think they can have more exposure than before. And more of their private life is out there. Everyone is reading about it. Everyone knows about it. Maybe it's not a good thing, actually. But it's good also for more people to get to know them because social media is like globalization. It connects all the world. You can know anything in like one minute, actually. So, this is the difference, I think. Yeah, right. And can celebrities have a positive influence on the public? Well, of course. If the celebrity chooses to give a show a good example, which I think they should, then they have a good influence. This is what I think celebrities should do. They just show what to do to give money to charities, for example. Not just some scandals with other celebrities. This is pretty much degradating. So, they should show a good example to other people to follow. Indeed. And do you think the media give too much attention to famous people? The media does give too much attention to famous people. Actually, maybe not too much. I think too much on the media is about news and the tragic, terrible things that happen in the world. But I don't think it's so much about celebrities, actually. It is a lot, but not too much, I think. It can be more about the good things and good examples and focus on the good things, not just about tragedies and scandals. Okay. And do you think news stories about celebrities are always true? News stories about celebrities aren't always true. It could be a rumor. You cannot actually tell unless you ask them and interview celebrities. You cannot actually know. It's like a rumor. This is what people sometimes live on. They just want to gossip.

So, if you're talking about location, I would go with south, north and east, west. What else, what else do we have? Sometimes, we're not hearing the plural sound.

1.0,"First I'd like to ask about your job. What do you do? Okay, so that's easy. So, nowadays, I'm working in a German company. I'm doing totally different from what I studied, for example. So, this company is about software and what we do is scanning different documents from different companies. Do you prefer to work in the morning or in the evening? Well, from my perspective, I would tell you that I'd like to work in the mornings. But I've been discovering the advantages of working, you know, like, during the evenings. And I think, like, both suit me really good. What are the ways that you can improve your skills at work? Well, and to my concern, I think there are different ways. You can socialize, for example, you need to be a team player. And once you talk to more people, you know, you get more skills from them. So, you're constantly learning from other people. Let's now talk about clothes. Do you wear the same style of clothes on the weekends and on the weekdays? I mean, I want to be honest, I would say yes. But I'm a person that is constantly trying to change and, you know, innovate the clothes. Like the style itself. So, let's say that in the morning, I'm one and then I go home and I change my clothes. So, you know, I'm not like a picture to people. So, and the same for the weekend. So, because I like to go out with friends. So, it will be the same. What kind of clothes do you never wear? Well, now that you asked me, I never thought about it. But I think I don't really like to use formal clothes. I would just use formal clothes when I go to work. For example, the time I was a teacher, I would be using different clothes, like really formal clothes. But now, on the contrary, like I'm not using them anymore. Since, you know, in my job, they don't really ask for formal clothes. Did you have any special clothes when you were a child? Well, like I wouldn't say my... I would say my special clothes, you know. Like something that was special and meaningful to me was the sweater that my grandmother gave me. Because she passed away. So, for a long time, the sweater was meaningful. Like really significant in my life. So, it was something that I was really using, you know. Like from Monday to Friday. Now, let's talk about making a list. Do you make a list before going shopping? Yeah, we can say that, you know. Because it's not a list that I write with my hands, but it's in my mind. So, I like to schedule everything. Like even going shopping. You know, a way to schedule is like to plan beforehand. So, I like to make this mental list in my mind. Which is like from one to ten items. And with this, at least I have an idea of what to buy. So, I don't overspend my money. Why is it important to make a shopping list? From my perspective, and to be honest, making a list helps you not only to save money. But also to save your time. Because I think time is really valuable. And since, for example, I'm working. So, I cannot be all the time shopping. So, what I do for example, I go shopping. And I try to have a chronometer. So, I don't spend that much time. Like 20 minutes and that's not a lot. Do you prefer using a piece of paper or making a list on your phone? As I said, for example, I like to do it mentally.

Part 2 (student answering the 2nd part open question): 
Okay, so, I was asked to tell you about a group project that I have. And I would like to start by mentioning the last project that I did, actually, with my classmates. It was a project about immigration, but a specific immigration that we have here in Germany because of the current situation with the war in Ukraine. And we were speaking about a group of people that is called gypsies, which is, I think, not correct to call them like that. They have their own name, which is Romans. And, well, the project was about this. And I was asked to work with two classmates from my master's program. They are Penelope and, I think, her name is Lorena. So, it was the three of us working in this project. We really enjoyed it. And it consisted of a podcast of three episodes, actually. So, in these three episodes, we had the opportunity to tell and explain to different people about the current situation. And it was really, really nice. The result was amazing. But, to be honest, we were a bit lost. We couldn't find our feet at the beginning. We were really lost. But once we put all our ideas together, we came with this really amazing idea about making three episodes. Because we thought at the beginning about making just one episode. And instead of a podcast, it will be a video. But, thanks to the organization we had and after a certain feedback from different people, including the teacher, we came with this good opportunity to make this project. So, just to mention something that I really, really love about this project was the fact that we had a special guest. Someone that came and was there to speak and clarify the situation. So, with that, we not only had a chance to get a good grade, but we also got the chance to face the reality of the happenings in Europe. Thank you very much. Now, your time is over.
Part 3 (student and teacher's dialogue): 
What kinds of qualities does a leader need to have in your idea? Well, as a teacher, and from my perspective, like, I can really be honest with you. I think, as a teacher, I was a leader, and I was in charge of helping students to improve. So, a leader, in this case, a teacher, is there to instruct people, to teach them, and to make the things difficult easy for them to understand. Okay, and what are the reasons for the failure of teamwork? The failure of teamwork is normally because it's not planned. So, we need to schedule everything, to book everything. So, if we need to gather because we need to organize our ideas, that is a must. So, in order to achieve our goals, we need to organize ourselves, and that's how we can stay above failure. Okay, and would you work in a team if you had the chance to? Yeah, like, definitely. Because I've been developing my skills working with different people all around the world. Not only in Mexico, but also here in Germany, and not only in the university, but also at work. So, I think I'm ready, and I'm still developing. And do you consider working with a team more difficult than working alone? In my opinion, it could be both, because, you know, you have advantages and disadvantages. So, I think one advantage of working with people is that you can organize the work in different stages. So, for example, one person is in charge of one stage, then we pass it on to the next person, so everything is completed on time. And when you are working alone, you need to adjust to yourself. And maybe that's more comfortable for certain people, but for me, I think I prefer to organize and to instruct others how to do a task. Don't you think that this can result in negative competition among the people who work together? I think competition is really healthy, but it depends on how we aim to cover the necessities of people. So, for example, what I do, we gather in a circle and I ask people, okay, we have these different tasks, what would you like to do? So, I'm always guiding the work according to the necessities and the likes of people. So, if someone that is there tells me, okay, I would like to do this, of course, go ahead, you can take it. And this is the way we step up this confidence of this bad feelings towards working in teams. Do you also think that children need to know more about teamwork from an early age? I do think so. I couldn't agree more with you, because I think it is important to instruct our children about the benefits of working together. So, society was built together and it will be in the next years. So, I think children need to learn that from now on. Okay, thank you very much. Now, this is the end of the speaking test.

Although the weather is a little bit hot, I like it. Okay, and what can a visitor do there? Well, actually, there are many different sightseeing here, such as different museums, or maybe local parks. And I do recommend you go to the international restaurants there. What are the common occupations of people there? Well, many people, actually, are engineers, or many of them are also teachers, and work in university, or maybe at schools. Okay. Now, let's move on to talk about travel. Are you fond of travels? Yes, I do like travelling a lot. And what insights do travelling to places bring in a person? Would you please repeat your question, please? Sure. What insights do travelling to places bring in a person? Well, actually, I do love travelling because it can broaden my horizon. I can have this opportunity to see the world differently. I can see the cultures, different cultures, different customs. And because of that, I become able to have a different point of view of the world. And how do you plan your travel? Well, actually, I have a certain itinerary whenever I want to go travelling. For example, before getting started, I just plan the exact date, and after that, I phone my family members or my friends and make them ready for a good travel. Okay, great. Now, let's move on to talk about schools. Did you have many friends in school? Unfortunately not. I wasn't that much a naughty student. I was a little bit shy, and I didn't have this opportunity to have different friends at school. Can you mention a cherished school memory? A school memory, which really I like that. Well, actually, I remember one time I just expected myself that I will just ruin my math exam. Then after that, unexpectedly, I could pass the exam with flying colours. That was my indelible moment at school. Great. And what kind of things do schools offer in your country for a student? Schools in my country actually offer many different academic facilities. They do offer some laboratories, and they provide a lot of facilities in the laboratories or maybe some swimming pools. Furthermore, I think students are able to study through projects and many different electronic things. Okay, thank you very much. Now we can move on to the second part of the exam.",212.0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuKvH8a9aug,"Great, and I would like to start with the first criteria, which is your fluency and coherence. In your fluency and coherence, I can say that a very good thing is that you are able to talk about the different topics, familiar or unfamiliar ones, fluently. And you can develop the topic, you can just give the answer and then you provide explanations and examples, which is really good. However, just make sure to always provide explanation in your answers in the first part. Because your answers in part one should be two to three sentences, it means that when you give the answer, a yes or no or a word, then you should explain about it. Never give a one-sentence answer or a very short answer. In the second part, you covered your two minutes and you talked about all the bullet points, which gave you the chance to use more collocations or more grammatical structures. And in part three, you gave me some longer answers. And if I interrupted you sometimes to ask you further questions, there was no problem, because this is the structure of the third part, that the examiner interrupts you to ask you more questions. It's more like a discussion in part three. So you are able to develop a topic really, really well and coherently. And other than that, I could hear a wide range of connectives. Like, for example, other than and so, but because, the simple ones. You were also using because of that. Although, furthermore, as a result, also in order to, rather than, or such as, for example, so these are very necessary words that you should use if you want to get a good score in your fluency and coherence. Other than that, you were using good discourse markers. Like, well, actually, you know, just try to keep the same range on exam day and don't repeat one word or one discourse marker all the time. So this was really good and you just had a few pauses or self-repetitions, but it was only because you were just thinking of the next idea that you wanted to elaborate on. So all you were speaking was very, very natural. So because of all the things I mentioned, you got an 8 in your fluency and coherence, which is a very good score. And now we can move on to the next criteria, which is your lexical resource, your vocabulary. Your vocabulary is one of your strongest points because you were using a range of collocations and some idiomatic language in different topics. You didn't actually need to fake your answer or go off-topic to find a better vocabulary range. You were just able to talk about whatever topic you were given. Like you talked about, for example, the advertisements you were talking about or then about the traveling or the item that you have at home. So this was really good and to mention some, for example, the word to have an opportunity, to run a class, to fix an appointment, to broaden the horizon, or my phone cracked down to go window shopping. Your daily chores. User-friendly or even very good paraphrasing, because paraphrasing is also very important if you want to get a good score. Like you were paraphrasing my sentences, my questions actually, because it's necessary to paraphrase the examiner's question using direct synonyms and you were doing that. For example, instead of the word give, in the sentence you use the word provide. Or essential instead of important and many other direct synonyms you were using for the words, which is really good. So that's why you got another 8 in your lexical resource. However, I do recommend you to just give a wider range to your idiomatic language as well because it's important. Other than the collocations you're using and a good paraphrasing and fillers and boosters, you can use more idiomatic language to just get the same score on exam day. Now, concerning your grammatical range and accuracy. In your grammar, I can say that you were using a range of complex structures and more importantly, you were using them correctly. Because being error free is a lot more important than using some structures and words that you're not sure about. And you were using them correctly. For example, I could hear subordinate clauses, relative clauses, conditional sentences, or compound sentences. You just made a few minor mistakes, like I would like to talk about, I would like to talk, you should have said I would like to talk about. Or that appliances, those appliances. One of the reasons, which is not that important, but you just need to be careful with singular, plural, these little tiny mistakes. And if you can use these complex structures just like that, or even more flexibly, then it is very good for your score. Because you should know that you have to consciously use complex structures. It is what you're expected to do according to this criteria. And finally, your pronunciation because you also got another H in your grammar, and now we can move on to your pronunciation. In your pronunciation, the good thing is that your pace is fine. You're not speaking very fast or very slowly. And it's very clear to understand whatever you're talking about. And you were using a range of pronunciation features, like for example, your sentence stress, your word stress, or you didn't have mispronunciations, just except for the word academic, you didn't pronounce it well regarding the word stress. But generally your pronunciation is very clear and your own accent has no negative impact on your English accent, which is really good. And now to talk about your overall band score as you got another H in your pronunciation. So to wrap up, you got an H in your fluency and coherence. It is really good, just try to keep using the same connectives. And regarding your lexical resource, you got another H. You deserved it because you were using a range of collocations. Just use more idiomatic language if you can. In your grammar, you got another H. Stick to complex structures because you're not making mistakes and you have the potential to use them more flexibly. And finally, in your pronunciation, another H. That would bring you an overall band score 8 in your today's speaking mock test, which is a very good score.

Now your time is over and we can move on to Part 3.
Part 3 (student and teacher's dialogue): 
Do people in your country try new gadgets and appliances in the market? Well, actually, you know, cost of living is increasing these days in Iran, and because of that many people are not able, I mean, they're not, they can't afford many different new technologies, like, I don't know, a mixer or maybe kitchen appliances, because they're becoming really expensive nowadays. Okay, and some people find it easy to follow instructions while assembling a gadget, while others find it difficult. Why do you think is that? Well, you know, many products are user-friendly. They have complete instructions and, you know, customers can read the instructions thoroughly and find it easy to use with that, I mean, appliances or maybe electronic gadgets, but many of those products don't have beneficial instruction for their customers. So, I think this is the main point. Okay, so do you think that that's the reason why some people find it uncomfortable to use new products at home or at work? Well, this is one of the reasons. Another reason is that many people don't want to change at all. They like to stick to their routines and they don't want to explore new things and find many useful things, I mean, around them. So, because of that, I think people need to accept some minor changes in their lives in order to embrace new things. Okay, great. And how about the advertisements? Do you think that advertisements play a key role in promoting innovative and trendy products these days? Well, actually, advertisements are somehow inducing and make people infuriated sometimes because some pop-up ads or maybe the flyers when they are on the walls, I think they're not that much appropriate for attracting customers. They also use some, you know, slogans and catchy slogans and some gimmicks to attract the customers, but I think they won't be sufficient. Okay. And do people now prefer to buy local products or imported items? Well, actually, I think people in my country like to buy local products. Why is that? Because the price is much cheaper and nowadays the life expenses is becoming a concerning issue, so I think they are just a fan of local products rather than new international things. Okay. Thank you very much. Now this is the end of the speaking test.

2.0,"Okay, an essential thing, an essential item I would like to talk right now is my cell phone. You know, it is considered to be one of those electronic gadgets these days which is really vital in our daily lives. You know, I do it because of some reasons. I have it because of some reasons. For example, I'm an I'm a teacher and because of that I run my classes virtually. As a result, I need this electronic gadget, I mean my cell phone, to have my classes online. You know, if I don't have it, I won't be able to run my classes. Also, I think it's really good to communicate with my friends whenever we want to hang out with each other. We fix the appointment through such apps, through some apps in my cell phone. Actually, one time I remember it was a really hard time for me because my cell phone cracked down and I realized that I am not... I wasn't able to run my daily life because I was a little bit addicted to it. It was so useful to me. Then I went window shopping and then I purchased a, you know, state-of-the-art cell phone for myself to again be able to do my daily chores. I think my electronic gadget, my cell phone, is really essential these days for me because it helps me a lot and I am really helped and I am really, you know, I am able to do so much kinds of things in my life. You know, I think people can be really... I think people really need these electronic gadgets these days because technology... Thank you very much. Now your time is over and we can move on to Part 3.",127.0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuKvH8a9aug,"Great, and I would like to start with the first criteria, which is your fluency and coherence. In your fluency and coherence, I can say that a very good thing is that you are able to talk about the different topics, familiar or unfamiliar ones, fluently. And you can develop the topic, you can just give the answer and then you provide explanations and examples, which is really good. However, just make sure to always provide explanation in your answers in the first part. Because your answers in part one should be two to three sentences, it means that when you give the answer, a yes or no or a word, then you should explain about it. Never give a one-sentence answer or a very short answer. In the second part, you covered your two minutes and you talked about all the bullet points, which gave you the chance to use more collocations or more grammatical structures. And in part three, you gave me some longer answers. And if I interrupted you sometimes to ask you further questions, there was no problem, because this is the structure of the third part, that the examiner interrupts you to ask you more questions. It's more like a discussion in part three. So you are able to develop a topic really, really well and coherently. And other than that, I could hear a wide range of connectives. Like, for example, other than and so, but because, the simple ones. You were also using because of that. Although, furthermore, as a result, also in order to, rather than, or such as, for example, so these are very necessary words that you should use if you want to get a good score in your fluency and coherence. Other than that, you were using good discourse markers. Like, well, actually, you know, just try to keep the same range on exam day and don't repeat one word or one discourse marker all the time. So this was really good and you just had a few pauses or self-repetitions, but it was only because you were just thinking of the next idea that you wanted to elaborate on. So all you were speaking was very, very natural. So because of all the things I mentioned, you got an 8 in your fluency and coherence, which is a very good score. And now we can move on to the next criteria, which is your lexical resource, your vocabulary. Your vocabulary is one of your strongest points because you were using a range of collocations and some idiomatic language in different topics. You didn't actually need to fake your answer or go off-topic to find a better vocabulary range. You were just able to talk about whatever topic you were given. Like you talked about, for example, the advertisements you were talking about or then about the traveling or the item that you have at home. So this was really good and to mention some, for example, the word to have an opportunity, to run a class, to fix an appointment, to broaden the horizon, or my phone cracked down to go window shopping. Your daily chores. User-friendly or even very good paraphrasing, because paraphrasing is also very important if you want to get a good score. Like you were paraphrasing my sentences, my questions actually, because it's necessary to paraphrase the examiner's question using direct synonyms and you were doing that. For example, instead of the word give, in the sentence you use the word provide. Or essential instead of important and many other direct synonyms you were using for the words, which is really good. So that's why you got another 8 in your lexical resource. However, I do recommend you to just give a wider range to your idiomatic language as well because it's important. Other than the collocations you're using and a good paraphrasing and fillers and boosters, you can use more idiomatic language to just get the same score on exam day. Now, concerning your grammatical range and accuracy. In your grammar, I can say that you were using a range of complex structures and more importantly, you were using them correctly. Because being error free is a lot more important than using some structures and words that you're not sure about. And you were using them correctly. For example, I could hear subordinate clauses, relative clauses, conditional sentences, or compound sentences. You just made a few minor mistakes, like I would like to talk about, I would like to talk, you should have said I would like to talk about. Or that appliances, those appliances. One of the reasons, which is not that important, but you just need to be careful with singular, plural, these little tiny mistakes. And if you can use these complex structures just like that, or even more flexibly, then it is very good for your score. Because you should know that you have to consciously use complex structures. It is what you're expected to do according to this criteria. And finally, your pronunciation because you also got another H in your grammar, and now we can move on to your pronunciation. In your pronunciation, the good thing is that your pace is fine. You're not speaking very fast or very slowly. And it's very clear to understand whatever you're talking about. And you were using a range of pronunciation features, like for example, your sentence stress, your word stress, or you didn't have mispronunciations, just except for the word academic, you didn't pronounce it well regarding the word stress. But generally your pronunciation is very clear and your own accent has no negative impact on your English accent, which is really good. And now to talk about your overall band score as you got another H in your pronunciation. So to wrap up, you got an H in your fluency and coherence. It is really good, just try to keep using the same connectives. And regarding your lexical resource, you got another H. You deserved it because you were using a range of collocations. Just use more idiomatic language if you can. In your grammar, you got another H. Stick to complex structures because you're not making mistakes and you have the potential to use them more flexibly. And finally, in your pronunciation, another H. That would bring you an overall band score 8 in your today's speaking mock test, which is a very good score.

Beautiful mountains, beautiful nature, landscapes for tourists, for everyone, even the residents of the capital, the capital dwellers to go and visit, aside and away from all of the busy life. Okay, and what's the most interesting part of your town? Well, as I mentioned, it's a combination of some dark sides, which is the heavy traffic, and at the same time, the beautiful parts of it. Of course, as I mentioned, the natural resorts on weekends, and even sometimes on weekdays at nights, you can go above the mountain with your family, enjoy the scenery, the beautiful places, the glamorous lights of the city. And would you like to move to another city? Given the situation and the fact that I'm living in this city, I cannot physically relocate and go to another city, and at the same time, why should I relocate while I'm having a good life here in the capital? Okay, now let's move on to talk about cycling. Did you learn riding a bicycle when you were a child? I did learn when I was a child, and my older brother Ali taught me how to ride a bike. I fell a couple of times, and I remember that he slapped me on my face, and that slap in the face gave me the motivation to try to learn riding a bicycle. And what do you think are the benefits of riding a bicycle for a child? For a child, it improves your physical abilities, preparedness, and as we have this idiom in Persian that a sound mind and a healthy mind lies in a healthy body. So, if you cycle, if you ride a bicycle, you have a healthy physique, and then you're going to have a healthy mind. And is it safe to ride bicycles on the roads? It depends on the settings of urban landscapes and urban areas. If the municipality thinks of ways to allow this for people to ride on the roads, it's going to be perfect because it's going to reduce air pollution, encouraging people to ride a bicycle instead of driving a car. That will lead to a cleaner environment. Now let's move on to talk about numbers. Sure. Do you often use numbers to do something? I do, because I'm a journalist, and a journalist always has to deal with different numbers. Crunching numbers is a must for a journalist to talk about statistics, talking about populations, talking about the number of people turning out for an event. So, yes. Okay, and are you good at memorizing numbers? No, I'm not good at memorizing numbers. I'm good at math. I'm good at some formulas, but I'm not good at numbers, memorizing them, especially as I try to remind myself that sometimes in the course of my career as a journalist, I have to come up with numbers more than seven digits, and that I find really difficult.

Part 2 (student answering the 2nd part open question): 
And the one interesting post that I came across, it was during my career as a journalist. I was around five years within my career as a journalist. I came across this interesting and ludicrous post about the former US President Donald Trump's misuse of the word Persian Gulf. He referred to the Persian Gulf as Arabian Gulf. And it ignited a wave of mockery across the social media. I saw people, because I'm a journalist, so back then I was assigned with this task to cover Iranian's reaction to Trump's use of, or misuse of, the word Persian Gulf. And then it was really hilarious how people tried to play down his usage of this body of water. I came across some people, I interviewed a lot of people who said that Donald Trump does not know geography. Perhaps he has to go back to school and try to learn geography again. And then all of those jokes about Donald Trump were really amusing to me. And then, I guess, when you go to social media, social media, one of the reasons why social by ordinary people who are active on social media. And the fact that the jokes come from the heart of society, by people who you, all the time, speak to and interact with and engage yourself in your life with most of the times. So those jokes are produced genuinely. So those jokes speak to your heart and speak to your mind because they are originated from the hearts and minds of ordinary people in society.
Part 3 (student and teacher's dialogue): 
Related to this. Do you think social media apps are most popular these days? Social media apps are more than popular. They are the basis for day-to-day life because people are getting used to social media more than ever. And that is why every aspect of their lives, every dimension of their day-to-day activities are going to depend on social media. We're purchasing many of our needed items on social media. We're calling our friends on social media. So, it's not about popularity. It's about dependability on that, and we're now attached to social media. And do you think people spend too much time on these apps? Of course. I think, ummm... This question is embedded within the answer to the previous question. And, ummm... people are resorting to social media more than ever because everything they demand is inside that sphere. It's inside that area of social media. So, everything you want to do, even sometimes checking your back accounts, you need to go to your cell phone and investigate the recent messages on your account app. So, that is why we refer to it a lot of times today. And what kind of apps do young people use mostly in your country? A wide range of apps with different applications. Apps come from the word application, so they have to have a specific application. Some sports apps, apps that act as library, involving some books, which you can go and shuffle through the books and find your favorite topics and favorite genres of books and even some apps that teach you some languages, like Duolingo, which is now becoming very popular among the youngsters. And should children be encouraged to study through educational apps on phone? Of course. As a person who is involved in society, I think that the future of society is all about applications and cell phones and smartphones and with the emergence of some creative applications and even in a chat GPT, for example, we can see a growing trend towards a better application. Applications that involve teaching children new things and even their textbooks. So, I think yes, children should be encouraged to at least learn how to use those applications because the future is all about it. Okay. Thank you so much. This is the end of the speaking.

1.0,"about studying. What do you study? Right now, I'm studying three subjects. Drama, music, and performing arts. So, that's a combination of dance, music again, and certain type of acting. Okay, do you like that subject? I love these subjects very much because I actually didn't know which one to pick. I decided to go for the music, first of all, and then I realized I also love theater studies as well. So, then I realized I also love media. So, I picked performing arts to get more involved. Okay, and what was your first day like in this subject? It was very exciting, to be honest with you, because I was really struggling with mathematics and science and all these subjects that the school and the national curriculum really wanted us to study, and they said you have to have these qualifications, otherwise you cannot take further studies. So, I thought it was very exciting to go ahead and pick these subjects that I feel I'm more comfortable with and that I like very much. Okay, very good. Now, let's move on to talk about music. What's your favorite type of music? Oh, it's funny you should ask that because I happen to be a musician and I play the piano. So, I love all sorts of genres, if I'm going to talk about music, but to answer your question and pick one in particular, in fact, I'll pick two for you. I love classical music and new age and also a mix of pop in between as well. Okay, very well. Can you sing? That's the embarrassing question that lots of people ask me. Can I sing? Well, I do sing in the choir sometimes, but I would never take the risk and be a solo singer. I prefer to be just the musician and play the piano or even take a second instrument. Okay, very well. Now, let's talk about neighbors and neighborhood. Do you like your neighbors? To be honest with you, I have good neighbors and bad neighbors. I don't want to name anybody, but some neighbors, they're just not very cooperative if you want to have a bonfire in the garden. So, on the left-hand side of my father's house, we have Rosaline. So, she's very nitpicky. She's always complaining a lot, and we cannot turn the music up very much. And are your neighbors usually close to each other in your country? Not particularly. I don't think neighbors or people who live next to each other in the UK are particularly close unless you have a very special friendship and atmosphere in the road, but you can find the odd, the now and then. Okay, and what is your neighborhood like? Our neighborhood in North London is a very peaceful place. I would prefer to live there all the time if I'm going to compare that to central London because it's suburban, and we have lots of green areas, we have a local park, and you can sleep soundly at night without the noise of anything else. Great, thank you very much.",191.0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nj9xEQZbtYs,"Yes, yes, that's totally right. Because, Samson, what I loved about your speaking was a wide range of, as you said, vocabulary that you were using. So I would say that was enough, even more than enough. And that would just give you a very good score in your lexical resource. But if I just wanted to start with your fluency and coherence, what was really outstanding in your speaking is the flow of a speech you have. Like, you do not stop when you are talking and you're very fluent while you're speaking English. And on the other hand, I didn't really notice any self-correction or self-repetition. You didn't repeat yourself. You were just using all the words and all the structures correctly, accurately, and that was really good. I couldn't really notice any effort to just keep on talking to me. So that was just wonderful. Maybe you had some hesitations, a few, not many, but it was all about... you were just trying to come up with ideas. And you know, when you know what you want to say, what language you want to use, then these hesitations are ok. You were not looking for words, you were looking for ideas, and that was just wonderful. Something else about your fluency that was really good was a good use of connectives and discourse markers. Like, when I was asking you a question, you were just paraphrasing my question and using some boosters. That's a good thing to do, is it? Of course, it's a good thing to do. I love the boosters you use. For example, in part one, you started one of your answers by saying, I happen to be something, and then you gave me the answer. Or, that's the embarrassing question I should answer. Or, not particularly. So you didn't give me a direct answer in the beginning. I was sort of buying time to actually answer the questions. Exactly. Because who knows how to answer all the questions. Some topics may be unfamiliar, right? How about you? Was it familiar to you? Because from what I understood, you had a lot to say about the questions. Thank you very much. Are we looking at quite a good band score here? Of course, we are looking at a very good. Could you give me a number, by any chance? We are definitely looking at a band score of 9 here. Oh, wow. Yes, because everything was just perfect. Really? And we were just talking about different criteria, so your fluency was wonderful, thank you very much. Thank you. To talk about your lexical resources, you use a very good range of collocations and vocabulary. And I could, from what I heard, you use some idiomatic vocabulary and uncommon collocations and words, and that is really good. It just boosts your score to 8 and more. And your paraphrasing was wonderful. I really loved that. You didn't repeat the same words that I was using in my questions. How was my pronunciation, by the way? Was it clear enough? Your pronunciation, you used a range of pronunciation features, and what was really good about your pronunciation was that you could link up different sounds. Like, it was not word by word. You were linking and just speaking very naturally, like a nativist speaker, as you are. Oh, thanks. So, like a nativist speaker, as a nativist speaker, that was great. And, Samson, I just have one problem with your speaking, generally in parts 1, 2, and 3, and that's the pace of your speech. Oh, is it too fast? It's a bit fast. Sometimes it's a bit fast. I mean, you managed to speak with that pace, and you answered all the questions very well. But sometimes, when you speak too fast, you may get a bit stressed, and it is more likely to make some grammatical mistakes, and the pronunciation of some words might not be clear if you speak very fast. So, maybe you can just work on that a little. I know you have a lot of information, but sometimes it was too much. You know? I needed a bit, you know... Slightly toned it down. Yes, exactly. And so, yeah, that's all about it. And your grammatical range, as the last thing I want to talk about, you use a range of complex structures. If I want to give you examples, for example, you were using conditional sentences very well, relative clauses, compound sentences, and I could hear some adverbs. You started some of your sentences, for example, by saying generally, definitely, you know, and you were talking about the different issues. So, that was really good. And in part two, what I realized was that you covered all the bullet points, which is just terrific. But after... You covered the two minutes, but after... You had like 10 seconds or 20 seconds left, and you kind of ran out of words, so you went off the topic, and you started talking about another show, right? That's right, because I thought it's good to complete the two minutes and keep the flow of speech. Yes, you should, and that's great. So, that was really good, you went off the topic and you didn't stop talking. The same thing happened in part three, like in question number four. You said, that's something I really wouldn't know. You didn't have an answer to the question. No, I didn't. But you didn't stop. No, I didn't stop, because you have to address the question, I thought. So, I just, you know, from a different angle go into the idea and start answering the question. Okay, great. Yes, that's totally right. Okay, yeah, I have good examples of what you did here. Yeah, the only problem I have is with the pace of your speech, which you managed really well, but yeah, maybe you can just work on that a little. And finally, the last thing I would say, the connectives and conjunctions that you were using. You were not just using and, so, because, but, it was more than that, like besides, unless, also, as well, you know, it's more conversational, I thought. Exactly. Just why not use them? Yeah, I could totally feel like I'm having a conversation with you, it was not like a real exam and you were so confident, we had eye contact. These are not part of criteria, but it really helps you to reduce your stress levels. It does, yeah. I felt better doing, just getting involved with the chat.",380.0,,9.0,9.0,9.0,0.3673076923076923,"Describe a quiz program or game show on TV you like. You should say:

Great, thank you very much.
Part 2 (student answering the 2nd part open question): 
Alright, so I've been asked to talk about a television quiz show that I like very much. I want to talk about Bruce Nolan's Generation Game. So, it is a quiz game, and basically it applies two families on the stage when they have a live audience. So, these two groups, these two families, basically, they would have to get into games and do different activities, and then they'll be scored at the very end. I've always found that very interesting because they get put in situations where they wouldn't know how to, for example, make pottery or how to act on the stage, depends what the activity is. We always watch this programme, we found out about it from ITV, their advertising. ITV is our Channel 3 in the UK, and we just love to sit around the television and watch that together as a family, we find it most fun. So, I enjoy the activities that they do, like I said, they get onto the stage, they have to do an acting game, or they'll be maybe making a painting to see who could perform the painting better than the other. And I always like the way the presenter hosts the show, he's always very energetic and the way he addresses the candidates and then the way he talks to the audience, it's always very theatrical and very friendly at the same time, then in between he goes on about joking and trying to encourage other people to get up on the stage and get involved, and sometimes he even picks on people in the audience. So it's a very, very fun show to watch. Another show I'd like to talk about is Cilla Black's Blind Date, and that's where she brings people on to actually matchmake people, single people of course, and then if they pick the hidden candidate and they like what the other person is saying, then they'll choose that person to maybe go on holiday, that's the thing, they'll go on a trip and then they'll come back next week. Thank you very much.
Part 3 (student and teacher's dialogue): 
Do people in your country like to watch TV? Well, I consider my country, if I'm going to answer this question, I consider the nation that I come from to be a country very much involved with the media. I'll call it the mother of all media, the UK, because they created the BBC, they created the BBC Radio many years ago. I think it was sometime in the mid-20th century. So, I think it's very, very important. They have governmental channels. They also have lots of private channels, and lots of people, plenty of people like to watch these channels. You can watch anything you want. You can view movies, TV series, soap operas, but nowadays, obviously, because of the internet and technology, people prefer to watch the same shows that our televisions are showing on their phones, maybe laptops, maybe Netflix. So, that's a social media channel and everything. So, there might be a pay-per-view, and they might want to watch a certain TV channel. Okay, great. Tell me about the types of programs that are generally on television in your country. Well, as I spoke about earlier in the previous part of this test, people love to watch quiz shows, I think, a lot, because it's very challenging, and the way they present these shows, it's very gripping. Not only do lots of people learn something, it could be a language-related show where there's something we have called catchphrase, and many people love to watch that and improve their vocabulary. But there's plenty of entertainment on our TV channels that many people like to look at. And how about you? Do you like such quiz shows on TV? I certainly do. I mentioned that earlier. And there's quite a few quiz shows that I would pick out. I would definitely pick catchphrase and the previous one I spoke about, Bruce Nolan's Generation Game, because it's just very creative. And this is something that will keep me involved. And the shows are not too long either, they're about 25 minutes long or 30 minutes long, and I think that's enough to sit down and watch a television quiz show. Okay. And why do some people like to watch TV on their computer? Well, that's a very debatable question if you ask me, because now if you look at the way generations are shaping out to be in the 21st century, it's not like the old-fashioned days where we'd sit in front of the television as a family and watch too many shows. Many people like to do things individually, especially with the technology accessible, like we have our laptops, we have tablets, and just walking around with our phones and being connected to the Internet. It's a lot easier to access the kind of home entertainment that many people are looking for. Okay, very good. And what is the difference between young people and old people's favorite TV drama? Well, that's something I really wouldn't know what to answer, because I don't actually know what young people are definitely watching in terms of drama. And the same goes with the elderly group of people. But I can maybe sense a pattern of what they're watching. So, if it's young people, they'll be probably watching a drama related to action, if we're talking about boys, males or men. If we're talking about girls, maybe they're most likely to view romantic things, romantic TV series. And why do you think is that? Why do they like to watch romantic movies? I think lots of these issues are to do with hormones. I mean, I don't like to be nitpicky and definitely generalize on all these things. But generally, girls love to watch TV series or movies that are romantic, and they have some kind of a sweet angle towards it. Boys, because they tend to be more energetic, and again, to do with the hormones, they love to watch action and be entertained with all that gripping stuff. Thank you very much. We are done with your speaking test for today.

Or, that's the embarrassing question I should answer. Or, not particularly. So you didn't give me a direct answer in the beginning. I was sort of buying time to actually answer the questions. Exactly. Because who knows how to answer all the questions. Some topics may be unfamiliar, right? How about you? Was it familiar to you? Because from what I understood, you had a lot to say about the questions. Thank you very much. Are we looking at quite a good band score here? Of course, we are looking at a very good. Could you give me a number, by any chance? We are definitely looking at a band score of 9 here. Oh, wow. Yes, because everything was just perfect. Really? And we were just talking about different criteria, so your fluency was wonderful, thank you very much. Thank you. To talk about your lexical resources, you use a very good range of collocations and vocabulary. And I could, from what I heard, you use some idiomatic vocabulary and uncommon collocations and words, and that is really good. It just boosts your score to 8 and more. And your paraphrasing was wonderful. I really loved that. You didn't repeat the same words that I was using in my questions. How was my pronunciation, by the way? Was it clear enough? Your pronunciation, you used a range of pronunciation features, and what was really good about your pronunciation was that you could link up different sounds. Like, it was not word by word. You were linking and just speaking very naturally, like a nativist speaker, as you are. Oh, thanks. So, like a nativist speaker, as a nativist speaker, that was great. And, Samson, I just have one problem with your speaking, generally in parts 1, 2, and 3, and that's the pace of your speech. Oh, is it too fast? It's a bit fast. Sometimes it's a bit fast. I mean, you managed to speak with that pace, and you answered all the questions very well. But sometimes, when you speak too fast, you may get a bit stressed, and it is more likely to make some grammatical mistakes, and the pronunciation of some words might not be clear if you speak very fast. So, maybe you can just work on that a little. I know you have a lot of information, but sometimes it was too much. You know? I needed a bit, you know... Slightly toned it down. Yes, exactly. And so, yeah, that's all about it. And your grammatical range, as the last thing I want to talk about, you use a range of complex structures. If I want to give you examples, for example, you were using conditional sentences very well, relative clauses, compound sentences, and I could hear some adverbs. You started some of your sentences, for example, by saying generally, definitely, you know, and you were talking about the different issues. So, that was really good. And in part two, what I realized was that you covered all the bullet points, which is just terrific. But after... You covered the two minutes, but after... You had like 10 seconds or 20 seconds left, and you kind of ran out of words, so you went off the topic, and you started talking about another show, right? That's right, because I thought it's good to complete the two minutes and keep the flow of speech. Yes, you should, and that's great. So, that was really good, you went off the topic and you didn't stop talking. The same thing happened in part three, like in question number four. You said, that's something I really wouldn't know. You didn't have an answer to the question. No, I didn't. But you didn't stop. No, I didn't stop, because you have to address the question, I thought. So, I just, you know, from a different angle go into the idea and start answering the question. Okay, great. Yes, that's totally right. Okay, yeah, I have good examples of what you did here. Yeah, the only problem I have is with the pace of your speech, which you managed really well, but yeah, maybe you can just work on that a little. And finally, the last thing I would say, the connectives and conjunctions that you were using. You were not just using and, so, because, but, it was more than that, like besides, unless, also, as well, you know, it's more conversational, I thought. Exactly. Just why not use them? Yeah, I could totally feel like I'm having a conversation with you, it was not like a real exam and you were so confident, we had eye contact. These are not part of criteria, but it really helps you to reduce your stress levels. It does, yeah. I felt better doing, just getting involved with the chat.",380.0,,9.0,9.0,9.0,0.3746355685131195,"Describe a quiz program or game show on TV you like. You should say:

But now people have card and buy anything with card. Okay, and do you ever save money to buy special things? Well, I think it's not...

But now, all of the time, the people work and work and work, but can't make big money, I think. And let's move on now to talk about sports. What's your favourite sports? My favourite sports is spinning, mountain climbing, swimming, I love all of the sports. Okay, and what is the most popular sport in your country? In my country, I think now the sport is... Young people can do any sport, like yoga, like fitness. Young people like fitness, the boy and the girl like fitness. But I like mountain because in nature, it's very good energy and can find good energy. I love mountain climbing. Okay, good. And did you play sports as a child? Yes, of course. Yes, of course, the child can play sports, any sports. Now, it's better. I think the child is important to exercise and do sports because when the child grow younger and grow older, the health is better. Okay, thank you very much.",263.0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJDD0bhXAOQ,"back on in how you did. So, the band score right now, we're looking at a four. At the moment, it's four. But, you know, we can improve that. You can, you can improve to a five and then from then on, you can improve how you can reach a six. So, you know, there's a few techniques, quite a lot of techniques you would really need to look at. So, right now, the whole thing, the overall band score is a four. Let's look at fluency and coherence. So, this is how naturally you speak. So, I mean, at the beginning of the test, you used some boosters. You could, you know, just start simple conversation, which was good. Unfortunately, you know, you, I think you misunderstood lots of questions. That was the biggest problem here with the fluency and coherence. I mean, you had lots of frequent self-repetition, self-corrections. Some of your answers, you know, they were they were kind of unrelated, probably because it was hard for you to understand some of the questions. And you would need to elaborate, give reasons for your answers if you want to increase your score when it comes to fluency and coherence. So, it would be good to maintain the flow of speech and maybe, you know, just start talking and actually understand the questions related to the topic and talk about them. So, yeah, just work on these techniques. That would be very good. And, you know, the answers maybe sometimes in part three, exactly, in part three of the test, they were too short, need to be... expand them, make them longer. And that will help you a lot. So, vocabulary, it was, you know, it wasn't so bad, it was just limited. I mean, if you could expand on your vocabulary, work on your vocabulary that's related to the topic, that would help as well. So maybe, you know, concentrate on building up your vocabulary, learn some new words so you can use them effectively and especially if it's related. So, it's good to have vocabulary that's related to the topic. That's something I would definitely recommend there. Grammatical range and accuracy. So, this is your grammar and this is where you have frequent errors and jumping over certain structures and sentences. So you would need to fix a lot of these because the examiner, they pick up on all of your errors all the time. They will mark them down. And if it's maybe one or two, it doesn't matter. But if it's frequent and it's happening a lot, then it becomes a problem. And, you know, all these hesitations become language related, especially with the fluency and coherence. You know, when you're struggling and then, you know, you had a lot of fiddlers like umms and ahs, it's important to have linking words and maintain the flow of speech, fix the structure of your grammar and make it more accurate. So, you can start by doing that to increase your band score by one for the time being. Pronunciation, too. I mean, with simple words, you could pronounce them, but when it became more using complicated words, sometimes it's not a good thing because then when you have mispronunciations, that means it marks you down. So it's sometimes better if you cannot, if you find it hard to go for the more difficult words, maybe go for the more simple ones first to get more familiar. The ones that you are familiar with, you make less mistakes and you pronounce them correctly. Like in the beginning with part one, you were using more simple words and obviously there were less pronunciation problems. Also, you were rushing a lot. So, when you're having a discussion with the examiner, try to slow down speed and that will help you become more accurate and pronounce things correctly especially longer words, complicated words. Make sure you finish them and end them correctly. So, these are the issues that need to be worked on.",243.0,,4.0,4.0,4.0,0.5643776824034334,"Describe an interesting discussion you had as a part of your work or studies.

I discuss with my professor or my doctor what opinions were expert, he expert in my work, he helped me always, and he helped me to write my article and explain why you found the discussion interesting. I think discussion, discussion, it's not, it's when you, when I want to speak about my work, can be expert, when you study, you study and you learn about any article, you can describe anything.

Okay, and do you think that it's better to talk to friends and not family about problems? I think no. Good, sometimes you speak about any problem with friends or family is good, but especially, especially or should speak about the doctor, a psychology doctor, I think, because personality, when you have any problems or any, it's not important why, what problems, any problem, you should, people should speak about, with psychology, not friend. Friend can not good way, I think, for problems. Can, the friends can hear, but cannot make good way for another friend. Okay, and is it always a good idea to tell lots of people about a problem?

You can use them with some errors here and there, but when it comes to complex sentences or unfamiliar topics, sometimes you cannot manage to give the relative answer to my question. That is why I gave you another three in this part as well, and be careful with what words you should choose to describe a situation. Try to use the correct words. Your word choice matters. When you, for example, talk about an issue, your neighborhood, your friends, try to use the relative words. Your word choice matters. So your three in the lexical resource. First, grammatical range and accuracy. When you want to speak with simple sentences, you can rather handle those sentences, simple forms of the sentences, but you cannot make complex structures. And your simple sentences sometimes are associated with some errors and mistakes. For example, you said, that was there. You were talking a couple of items, and you said that was there. You should say, those items were there. Or, for example, when you were talking about your parents, my mother's name, right? My mother's name. You said my mother name and my father name. You should have said my mother's name and my father's name. And, for example, you said more better instead of better. You shouldn't add more to it. Or, more funny, funnier. So if you pay attention to those, these are very slight mistakes. You have to pay more attention to them, and I think that is, again, caused by your stress. Try to overcome your stress in order to have a better performance and hopefully a higher band score. The last part is pronunciation. I really didn't notice many mistakes when it comes to pronunciation. You were able to manage the intonation. You had the intonation, the rise and fall, but you need to pay more attention to special words and how those words are pronounced. For example, open-minded things. You should have said open-minded things. Open-minded people. We don't have open-minded things. And so you have to be careful with pronouncing the words. And, yes, that's it. That's it. Now tell me about your feeling and your take about yourself, and if you have any questions or concerns. I don't have any questions, but I hope for the next time I act or I do better for my exam or test. Sure. You can do it. If you just pay attention to the tips that I gave you today. And pay attention. When you are watching a movie, pay attention to how native people speak. Pay attention to the Ss, to the structures, to the pronunciation and all of those things. If you pay closer attention, better attention to how they speak, and you can do the shadowing technique. I mean, you can record your voice and try to utter the same sentences that you heard from a native speaker. And judge yourself. And do the subtleties and all of the needed tunings to your accent and to your grammatical capabilities.",380.0,,4.0,4.0,5.0,0.6017316017316018,"Describe an interesting art exhibition you attended.

Do you have a large or small family? I have a small family. I live, like, with my parents. And my father name is Ali. He's a doctor, and my mother name is Rahil. She's a painter, and I'm a student. I studied in high school. Is your family a typical family? Yes, it is. Are there many different types of family in your country? Yes, it is. There are so many different kind of families in our country, and... yes. Now, let's move on to talk about parks. Do you like parks? Why and why not? No, I don't. Because I think there's nothing to do in parks, and it's boring, I think. How often do you visit parks? I never visit parks. Why are parks an important part of many towns and cities? Umm, maybe, because people can have fun there, and they can do what they want, and children can play there, and... Now, let's move on to talk about patients. Are you a patient person? No, I'm not. What kinds of jobs require patients? Being a teacher, lawyer, doctor, and... Alright. Why should one be patient with little children and old people? Because they need attention, they need to be kind with them, and we have to talk with them all the time, and make some entertainment for them. Alright. This is the end of part one.

Ummm... I attended... an art exhibition two years ago, and... two years ago, and... I went to a museum with my school, and I saw some paintings, some... old things that was there in museum, and I liked them, because they gave me some feelings about past, and I think they're cool and interesting. I like old things, because they're so beautiful, and I love to buy them, and put them in my room, and... when I was there, I was feeling like can I brought them to my home, or my house, and... my father like them too, our family like them, and old things, and I think we should protect them, and don't hurt them, and... protect them to not hurt. Ummm... my mother... paints some paintings, and when she... when we go to museum, to a museum, she has the same feeling and, like me, and... once she told me I can paint them, paint a painting, was there.

Do you think people enjoy living and watching television or online? Some of people, yes, but some, no. I'm like a person who does, who likes it. And it's interesting for them, for people. Alright, what kind of live shows are popular in your country and why? I think a show that is so popular in our country is Joker and people laugh, people shouldn't laugh there. And it's so interesting for people who watch it. How are concerts and live shows now different from the past? I didn't understand you. It's okay, I'll repeat. How are concerts and live shows today different from the past? In our country? In some shows people can tell more things, more open-minded things in TV shows. But in the past people couldn't say special things or funny things a lot. And now they can be more funny and they can play with each other in shows. Alright. Now, is learning performing arts or drama encouraged among children in your country? Drama? I didn't understand. Sorry. It's alright, I'll go again. Is learning performing arts or drama encouraged among children in your country? There is some program and applications or TV shows in Iran for children that they can study or they can learn from it. And actually people in this time know it but they can learn it more and they can use it in their life and it helps them. Perfect. Do you think children must be encouraged to learn drama and other art forms like painting and dancing in schools? Why and why not? I think it's better to do it because it can help them to think better, to do things more better because they can focus, they can pay attention to things. For example, painting is so nice because they have to be so sensitive. Alright. This is the end of the speaking test.

1.0,"Well, in the first part of the exam, I'll ask you some personal questions. Let's talk about science. Were you good at science when you were in school? Science... Yes, I can vividly remember when I was knee-high to a grasshopper. I was keen on learning about science, and I can precisely say that I was good at science, and I am good at science. What was your favorite scientific subject? Without any shadow of doubt, it was biology. I can say now, it is my favorite subject, and the main reason for this is because I was keen on learning about the humans, how humans are produced, the structure of humans, how they think. So, mainly because of that. Okay. How do you science in your life now? I believe science has deeply penetrated its roots into our lives, and we have become dependent on science. So, there isn't any task which does not involve science. So, I use science on a daily basis. For example, I use biology to keep myself healthy, eat healthy. I use chemicals to be cautious of toxic gases and hazardous chemicals, whereas physics is being utilized by me to know and understand the day-to-day functions happening around me in my surroundings. Now, let's talk about creativity. Are you a creative person? I don't wish to boast myself, but yes, I genuinely believe that I am a creative person. The reason why I say this is because not one, but on many occasions, I have been appreciated for my creativity, my cognitive skills, my innovation, and my intelligence. So, yes, I do believe I am creative and innovative. What did you learn about creativity at school? At school, they didn't really teach me anything about creativity. I would say they tried, but what I know about creativity is that it requires you to get out of your comfort zone, to push your limits, to do what you haven't done, and expect the unexpected. So, that's what innovation requires. Are people in your country generally very creative? Yes, every country, every region, they have innovative people who can think out of the box. They can think different from other people. They have unmatched intelligence. So, yes, I do believe, not only in my country, but also in other countries, we can find innovative people. Now, let's move on to talk about social media. Do you like social media? Undoubtedly, yes. I use social media on a daily basis. So, there isn't any question about not liking social media. I use social media not only to communicate with my friends, as well as, but also keep in touch with my co-colleagues and teachers. What is the most popular social media in your country? Undoubtedly, it would be Telegram. Since Telegram serves many, many functions, it can help you keep in touch with your family members, your colleagues, your friends. It can help you access movies, it can serve an entertainment purpose, as well as provide books, so you may educate yourself. So, it's the most popular social media in my country. Do you think your friends spend too much time on social media? Yes, I don't think, but I believe they spend too much time on social media. There is a precise reason why I believe so.

Part 2 (student answering the 2nd part open question): 
I have also been a child, so without thinking further, I can say, I love children. I love children and the main reason for this is because of their innocence and their playful nature. I know a child who I am really keen on spending my time with. He's my cousin, Ahmed, and he's my uncle's son and he's just free now. And, he loves to roam around the house and if I'm doing anything, he would come and play with me, look at me, ask me to give him a pen and just fidget with my things. And, I love him because of his innocence. He does and says a few things which are... which he shouldn't be saying, but we are amused by his speech. So, I love his playful nature and another thing I can say is that he puts me in bright spirits. Whenever he's around me, I feel jubilant and over the moon because of his activeness. He forces me to play with him and, yes, I am forced to play with him. Have a good time and get rid of the workload and, you know, from my shoulders. And, I haven't done many activities with him since I am at work or at the university the whole day, but whenever I have free time, I love to spend my time with him. Take him out for a walk to the park, buy him a snack so he feels happy and relishes himself.
Part 3 (student and teacher's dialogue): 
We've been talking about a child that you know and like a lot, and I'd like to discuss with you more general questions related to this. What kind of bad behavior children usually have? As far as I can think, it's, uh... disturbing their parents while they are busy doing something really essential, fidgeting with their things and if an adult has kept something very crucial to them safe and because they don't know, they are naive, they would come and maybe break it. And for example, I can recall I had read this on social media that children ruined a 150 years old sculpture in a museum. So, yes, but it's out of their knowledge, so it's because of their innocence. Do you think children tend to behave badly when there are no strict rules? Yes, I can say. It's because parents have to teach them how to behave themselves, when to speak, where to speak, and where to play, because they shouldn't be playing at all the places. Maybe someone around them is not feeling well, they have gone through a tragedy, and maybe their nature or their laugh annoys them, so they should be taught. How should parents stop their children from behaving badly in public? Yes, there are several ways how parents can do this. Firstly, they can talk to their children, ask them nicely, maybe buy them a snack, a popsicle or an ice cream, so they can relish without speaking much. But children do annoy by talking a lot. Yes, I know they are chatterbox and they talk for England, but they are children, and if the children don't talk and play like us adults, there will be no difference between children and adults. So, yes, I believe there should be a difference between children and adults, and parents can simply talk instead of punishing their children. What do you think of corporal punishment to children? Hmm, I am strictly against corporal punishment. I wouldn't give any child corporal punishment. No, not for the love of money. Children should be handled with care and love, that's what they should be taught. And I think one of the most influential things for students is their surroundings. It's what they see and what they learn, not from what they hear. So, if adults around them behave in a bad way, they would do the same. And as far as corporal punishment is concerned, I believe no, they shouldn't be given corporal punishment. Okay, maybe they can be detained, they can be put into detention, but no, I am against it.

And for example, I can recall I had read this on social media that children ruined a 150 years old sculpture in a museum. So, yes, but it's out of their knowledge, so it's because of their innocence. Do you think children tend to behave badly when there are no strict rules? Yes, I can say. It's because parents have to teach them how to behave themselves, when to speak, where to speak, and where to play, because they shouldn't be playing at all the places. Maybe someone around them is not feeling well, they have gone through a tragedy, and maybe their nature or their laugh annoys them, so they should be taught. How should parents stop their children from behaving badly in public? Yes, there are several ways how parents can do this. Firstly, they can talk to their children, ask them nicely, maybe buy them a snack, a popsicle or an ice cream, so they can relish without speaking much. But children do annoy by talking a lot. Yes, I know they are chatterbox and they talk for England, but they are children, and if the children don't talk and play like us adults, there will be no difference between children and adults. So, yes, I believe there should be a difference between children and adults, and parents can simply talk instead of punishing their children. What do you think of corporal punishment to children? Hmm, I am strictly against corporal punishment. I wouldn't give any child corporal punishment. No, not for the love of money. Children should be handled with care and love, that's what they should be taught. And I think one of the most influential things for students is their surroundings. It's what they see and what they learn, not from what they hear. So, if adults around them behave in a bad way, they would do the same. And as far as corporal punishment is concerned, I believe no, they shouldn't be given corporal punishment. Okay, maybe they can be detained, they can be put into detention, but no, I am against it.",205.0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7PE7w7Ursc,"Well, we can see that the candidate is able to express his thoughts clearly.

Part 2 (student answering the 2nd part open question): 
Okay, umm... like, describe someone who likes cooking. So, my mom actually likes cooking, and she's very good cook. And she cooks mostly Uzbek dishes, because I'm living with my grandparents. My grandparents are used to eat only, like, Uzbek national dishes. And my mom cooks, like, three times a day, like breakfast, lunch, and dinner. And also, when I go to work, I carry containers of her food, and I eat it at work. So, why I think she enjoys it? Because she likes it. She has interest in it, and she likes to serve, she likes to be greeted. And, like, she likes it because everyone enjoys it.
Part 3 (student and teacher's dialogue): 
Well, I'd like you to discuss with me the general questions related to this. Do you agree that food is an important part of traditional festivals? Can I think about it, or no? Can I think about it, because, do I have time? Yeah, we can re-record. Umm, mainly, why I say that? Because every nation has its own festivals, celebrations, and not all of the nations are celebrating their festivals with food. Like, if we talk about Uzbekistan, of course, in North Russia we have traditional foods like sumalek, khalim, and without them, the festival is not like a celebration day or holiday. I can't imagine Nabrus without sumalek or khalim. Also, in Mostakilik, we have Day of Independence. In all the houses, in the Day of Independence, there is a plov. And without plov, you can't imagine it. And plov is like the food that brings joy, and when somebody makes a plov, there is something happening that they're celebrating. So, and also, in the weddings, there is a morning plov that we eat, and then go to the wedding. More and more people are unwilling to cook. Why is this happening? Because they are lazy. They all want to eat, not cook. Cooking is also like part of a job. Like, not everybody can cook. I learned to cook when I was a student, when I was abroad. I had a little money, so I should cook or I should spend. When I spend, so my money will be like... I ran out of money, and at the end of the month, I should cook also. Like, there is no way out. So I learned to cook because of this. So I had a way out. Is it important to have a meal together with your family? Yes, it is really important. It's not only about the meal. When you gather in the dinner with the whole family, it's like connection. It's like bond, family bond. I think it is very important to have a meal with your relatives.

Part 2 (student answering the 2nd part open question): 
So, one of the most crowded places I have ever been to was Central Market in the city. I went with some friends to see the celebrations there, and I could not believe the number of people there I saw that night. Most people went there to see the fireworks show, and the crowd was enormous. People there were just dancing, drinking, eating, they were just enjoying themselves, having the time of their lives. We went there at about 10pm, a few hours before midnight, and we thought it would be busy, but nothing prepared us for such enormous crowd, and then we saw that the traffic was very slow as we approached the downtown area and the central bridge on the river. And as we got closer to the bridge, we could see that the police had sealed off several blocks of the city, so we had to get out of our car and walk the rest of the way. And it took us 15 to 20 minutes to reach our destination, and on our way, as I got hungry, so I bought some food for myself. And eventually we arrived at the Central Square, and there were so many people, the streets were filled, and they were just... they were happy, they were enjoying, and then there was this fantastic lighting display, which illuminated the iconic buildings, and the whole sky was shining with fireworks. And then we all counted down to midnight, and then we turned to each other and wished each other a Happy New Year. And those were the prettiest fireworks I had ever seen in my life. And I'm really glad.
Part 3 (student and teacher's dialogue): 
Well done! So, would you go there again this year? Oh yes, as I have mentioned, I was actually discussing this with one of my friends yesterday, and we have planned to get our hair and nails done, and I'm going to buy a dress for the event. Can't wait, I'm excited. That sounds great. Now, would you say that the majority of cities in your country are overcrowded? Yes, I believe so. As we all know that India is the second most populous country in the world, and I think the main reason for the high population density is people moving from smaller towns and rural areas to bigger cities in search of employment and better living conditions, which creates a hustle and bustle in the cities and also because of political instability, and, you know, the streets in India are, they're very narrow, and people keep building illegal shops and houses, which makes the area even more congested, and due to improper enforcement of traffic laws, people bike there, people park their bikes and cars everywhere they want to, so I think it just increases the problem. Then, what are some problems that can result from overcrowded living conditions in a typical metropolitan city? When you try to cram such a high population in a congested area, I think it results in a greater level of pollution, both the noise and the air. Obviously, there will be more motor vehicles, which will result in more polluted air and more traffic noise, because the traffic grows in our city. And another problem would be, I think, disease vulnerability, as during the time of COVID, I saw that it was so hard to maintain social distancing, especially in the markets, if you're in India, because of the enormous crowd everywhere, and then there are other reasons. Lack of space also has a direct effect on your psychological and your physical growth as well, and then the exploitation of resources leads to inflation, and then there's lack of access to services, like clean drinking water or sanitation, which leads to more diseases, increased disease rate in India, and I think the crime rate increases as well. So, in your opinion, what are some solutions to this problem? I don't exactly know how to address this issue, but I think one solution could be building better infrastructure. The cities should provide better and safer housing for the people, as nearly 50% of the Mumbai's population lives in slums. I mean, they provide great plot for the feel sorry for the poor and lovely wretches for the liberal writing, but nobody tries to improve the situation or provide a solution for it. The grave consequences of overpopulation needs to be addressed by the government. The government should take steps to regulate the crowd somehow to disperse the population. Even the roads, they're so narrow, and even when they try to build flyovers, a project like that takes at least four to five years to get over in India, and during that time, your population doubles, and then you need another flyover, and I think it's important to control the flow of people, and for that, you first need to understand where the flow is coming from, and I think in short term solutions, like during festivals, we celebrate many festivals throughout the year. So if you have proper planning on how to disperse the crowd, you can avoid that. Absolutely. Now, can you compare the advantages and disadvantages of living in a high rise apartment? I can't say much, as I have never lived in one myself, but I think it will be fun as all the people were living in the same building, you will have a diverse neighborhood, you will socialize more, you will interact with people more, and if you're a fan of pretty views, as people in the big cities, they starve for full sky views, so I think if you're living on the top apartments, you can enjoy beautiful views around the cities, and obviously you will have the benefit of living a more peaceful life because there will be no traffic noise or noise from the streets up there, and yeah, I think those, and also living in such buildings is considered luxurious in India, so you have that. And disadvantages would be, I think, shifting, moving in and moving out would be a great stress for you, if you have a lot of furniture, and I think another problem would arise if you suffer from a medical condition or medical then it's not favorable for them to live on the 20th floor, at least. Other than that, I think slow elevators in some buildings are a problem. If you're in a hurry, you have to reach somewhere on time, that could be a problem. Other than that, I think it will be fun.

Part 2 (student answering the 2nd part open question): 
Umm, the leader I would like to describe here is Mr. Imran Khan, and the Prime Minister of Pakistan, to begin with, I have a lot of respect for him, and I think it's very difficult to say anything about his accomplishment because he always worked really hard to make our country run properly. He used to be a cricketer, and he was one of the best cricketer and a captain of our international team, and after retiring from cricket, he joined politics, and now he is Prime Minister. As a leader, he has a lot of things, and I believe, generally, he wants my country to be in progress. He took efforts to find the roadblocks and save our country from corruption, and I think the previous minister was very corrupt, and Imran Khan did all he could to improve the economy, and most importantly, he created equal rights for men and women, and reduced the social barriers. Umm, he became the leader by winning the most votes in the public elections. Honestly, I am not very much into politics, but I believe that he owns a national party, I think it's called Tehreek-e-Insaf, and during the 2018 election, his party won. Umm, also I think because he used to be a very popular cricketer in the past, so he has a lot of fan followers. That's how he became the leader. Umm, anyway, I admire him as a leader because of his visionary leadership. Umm, he actually changed the face of our Pakistan from a third world country to an economic powerhouse, so some people still blame him for corruption, but that's a myth. He is the best politician, I think.
Part 3 (student and teacher's dialogue): 
And tell me, do you think people are born to be leaders? Why or why not? Ummmm... No, I don't really like to think that people are born to be leaders, but I think the leaders are made by their circumstances. Or a sequence of events that happen. Of course, it takes some special skills and abilities, which may or may not be inherited, but one has to work really hard to master those skills and abilities. Ummm... But, on the other hand, just mastering those skills and abilities are not enough. Ummm... A person should know the proper use of those abilities to overcome the challenges at the right time to become a good leader. Can leadership skills be taught? Why or why not? Ummm... Yes, I do think that leadership skills can be taught and learned, because leaders are not some extraordinary people, nor they are born as leaders. However, the difference between the prospective leader and the others is that prospective leaders make a huge stride and are motivated to climb the ladder in order to help others and lead an organization where everybody else fails. Ummm... Of course, some people have some natural leadership skills and qualities, but it doesn't necessarily mean that others can't achieve them with hard work and dedication. I see, but why are elected politicians often so unpopular? Well, I think they are often so hated by many because they are financially corrupted and they can go to any extent in order to oppress the poor and silence their critique. Also, they are often failed to fulfill the promises to ordinary citizens and they use the wealth and unfair ways to... in order to oppress the poor and silence their critique. Also, they are often failed to fulfill the promises to ordinary citizens and they use the wealth and unfair ways and when these are elected, they just forget their responsibilities and exercise power for their own benefits while ignoring the well-being of majority of people. Then what should a leader do to remain popular? I think generally speaking, a leader has to understand the pulse of his or her supporters. Most of the time, he also has to be honest about how he chose to fight for the cause of his supporter base and besides that, a leader has to make sure that he doesn't earn his living by corruption or by flexing his muscles in order to remain popular or a politician has to work really hard to deliver on the promises in order to remain popular. In your opinion, what qualities should a political leader have? In my opinion, in order to be a good political leader, a person has to have some common qualities which may include patience, fairness commitment and a good educational qualification to understand the situation, the dynamic and ability to arouse the public passion in a positive way. Besides that, a political leader should also have the quality to connect with his supporters on a grassroot level so that he is able to know about either his supporters are happy or what makes them unhappy. Finally, he has to be honest and dedicated to the cause of bringing solutions to the problems but only for supporters but also for those people who don't support him.

Part 2 (student answering the 2nd part open question): 
That one important choice I had to make in my life, would definitely be the career choice that I made back in my 12th grade. I had a choice to make either... The options that I had back then were to choose either from pursuing my medical course or take up engineering as my profession, because I had done academically well in both the fields, so I had a choice then. It was a tough choice, but I went with my gut and I chose engineering as my career option. How I felt back then, while making the choice? Definitely, I was very anxious, I was overwhelmed, and I... Since I could not see the future then, I was pretty tensed of whether I'm making the right choice or not. As, once you know, once you go ahead, there's no way to come back. So, that... Those were the kind of mixed feelings that I was having back then. How I feel now about making that choice? I'm very satisfied with the choice I made back then. The reason... Part reason being, I did academically well during all four years of my engineering. It led me to a good career option, and even when I was doing it, I could always challenge myself, learn a lot of new things, and I'm still continuing to learn a lot of things. So, I think that is one reason that it gives me an opportunity to keep learning all the time, and I can challenge myself all the time, is main reason why I think...
Part 3 (student and teacher's dialogue): 
Okay. So, which websites are popular among your generation? I think the social networking sites, like Facebook, would be very popular among the youngsters. And once you are working and... when you reach at a point in your life where social networking isn't very important, I think Google, you know, any job website would be the one which take a lead. Okay. And what do you think this is? Google, because you get answers to all your questions. And job sites, because that's one place where you can just keep looking at the trends, the market trends, what kind of technologies are being used by various companies, what kind of job opportunities are out there in the market, and what are the pay packages available. Okay. Has the Internet changed social behavior? Yes, I think to a great extent. I remember times when I was growing up in school, we did not have any Internet. So, our only means of communication would be just to walk over to the person, talk to the person. So, we were never in isolation. We were always surrounded by a group of people with whom we would physically talk. As opposed to today's generation, I think they are more isolated. They need not want to be surrounded by people all the time, because they have easy access to Internet. They prefer spending time with virtual friends more than the physical friends. So, in your country, do people tend to be more social, or use social media? I think it depends from which region of the country you belong to. In metros, like Mumbai, or Delhi, or Bangalore, where there's easy access to Internet, I think people are more isolated, as opposed to the smaller towns, where Internet may not be readily available, people still resort to the older means of communication. Should companies check job applicants' online profiles? Yes and no. Yes, because that gives you a brief picture, an image of what the person would be. And no, because you could easily fake it up. Okay. Do people in your country typically have online profiles? Yes, they do. And what will be the next big development online? It's very hard to imagine what's next. But I think gaming would be something, especially in India, because it's not explored that well. But I think virtual gaming would be the next big thing. Okay. And are you interested in these sorts of things? No. Finally, let's discuss successful people. How do you define success? It's a very relative term, according to me. To a farmer, success would be if he has a good harvest, and if he earns good enough money by selling that harvest, for the entire year to feed his family. For a person like a Google CEO, success would be something that his shares are going up, and he's doing better than his peers. So, what would success be for people from your hometown or home country? For a working class, people who are into the job, for them, success would be if you grow up in a professional ladder, and you balance your time between your profession, as well as not miss out on the family time. That would be a successful person. And, like I said, the smaller towns, where farming is still the primary profession of them. Maybe for them, success would be having good enough money so that they could sustain the following year. What personal characteristics do you think most successful people need to have? I think when you start climbing up the ladder professionally, somewhere you lose track of being apologetic to people whom you've overstepped over the period of time. And also, you tend to forget to acknowledge the people who help you in your journey. So, I think that is one thing that everyone needs to remember over the period of time. And do you think happiness and success are related to each other? No, I personally don't think so. Okay, why? Happiness to a child would be just being around with his mom. He need not be successful. But a successful person, like I said, the corporate giants, they would spend most of their time thinking about the budget, the numbers and the figures. And they would miss out on the smaller happiness like seeing the child walk. So, I think that may not be related. Can children be successful? Yes. For what they are supposed to do at that age, if they do it, yes, they are successful for that particular period of time. Yes.

1.0,"All right. So, in the first part of the exam, I'd like to ask you some questions about yourself. Let's talk about the weather. Tell me about the weather in your country. In general, we have quite a mild climate, but perhaps because of global warming, it can get quite hot in the summer. We have also had a lot of flooding in parts of the country, which have also increased in recent years. Honestly speaking, I don't like extreme weather conditions. Rainy weather or really hot, sunny days don't appeal to me at all. I prefer the weather during autumn. It's not too hot and the days also get longer. To be honest, we usually spend our holidays walking in the countryside, so I prefer mild weather because it's not very enjoyable walking in heavy rain and not too sunny either, as it's easy to get sunburned if you are outside a lot of the day. Would you prefer to live in a country with a hot or a cold climate? Actually, I don't really like extreme weather conditions. The climate is quite mild in my country and it never really gets uncomfortable. I'm really not at all keen on hot weather, so I wouldn't like to live anywhere where it gets sweltering hot. Let's move on to talk about exercise. Do you like to keep fit? Yes, I take part in a lot of different sports. I play cricket for my college and go swimming once or twice a week. Having said that, I'm not fond of going to the gym. I find that a bit boring. Which sports are popular in your country? Cricket probably. It's certainly the one that most people talk about and watch on TV, even if they don't play it. However, other things like gymnastics is also very popular and possibly the activity that most people take part in. Did you do any sports when you were younger that you don't do now? I used to play basketball when I was at school, but I wasn't very good at it and didn't continue with it when I left. We used to do gymnastics as well and I enjoyed that, but again, I didn't do that once I finished school. Is there a sport that you'd like to do you had never done before?

All right. So, in the first part of the exam, I'd like to ask you some questions about yourself. Let's talk about the weather. Tell me about the weather in your country.

Part 2 (student answering the 2nd part open question): 
So, food plays an important part in my life. So, this is a good question. It's really hard to choose just one meal, as there are several things I enjoy eating, but if I had to choose one, it would be a curry. Perhaps one with chicken, from a restaurant near where I live. We eat a lot of foreign food at home. For example, Chinese, Italian, Mexican. Usually, my friends and I will take it in turns to cook, and we have curry at least once a week. Honestly speaking, our cooking is okay most of the time, but we have a takeaway on Friday evening as a treat. It's always difficult to decide what to have, but I try to persuade them to order Indian food. In the area where I live, there are lots of Indian restaurants, and I have probably tried all of them. But, there's one in particular that makes really nice curries. There are so many different kinds, and it depends on your taste, which one you would like best. What makes Indian food special for me is all the spices used. I usually order a hot curry, a dish with extra chilli in it. The first few mouthfuls burn a bit, of course, but you slowly get used to the heat. The food is always beautifully cooked, and they often give you something free, like small side dishes.
Part 3 (student and teacher's dialogue): 
We've been talking about the subject of food, and I'd like to discuss this subject with you with some more general questions relating to this topic. First, what is the appeal of eating out in a restaurant? I think one reason is that others do all the work, cooking the food, serving it and washing up afterwards. But also, it's exciting to eat out, especially if it's a nice restaurant with high-quality food. What do you think makes a good dinner host? Well, let me think. I think the host should be able to cook. It wouldn't be a very nice evening if the meal wasn't tasty. I think it's important that a host makes you feel comfortable as well. And they should also be good at keeping the conversations going to encourage everyone to have a good time. Fast food is often criticised by food experts. So, why is it so popular with people? Probably because it's quick and convenient. If you have had a busy day at work or have been studying all day long, you might not want to spend time cooking. In some places, you can just drive in, order your food, pay and drive home. So, it's very easy. Do you think it's always best to eat food with ingredients that have been produced locally? You know, I think it's good for the environment. It means food isn't being transported around the country or even around the world. It's obviously also good for the local economy. If food is brought from farmers and other food producers in the area. Is it important to eat together at the dinner table rather than in front of the TV, for example? My parents always made me and my sister eat at the table at meal times. We weren't allowed to have our mobile phones with us when we were eating. So yeah, in my opinion, this was a good idea as it meant we were able to talk to each other and find out what was going on in our lives at the time. How can we best encourage people to eat a healthy diet? To be honest, I think you need to start by educating children so that they get into good habits. It's a good idea to encourage them to help prepare food. I think there's more chance they'll eat things they normally wouldn't like if they are involved more in cooking.

1.0,"Very good. So, in the first part of the exam, I'd like to ask you some questions about yourself. Let's talk about books and films. What kind of books or films do you like? I enjoy reading, but I don't really have a favourite genre, but lately I have been reading a lot of science fiction. As far as films are concerned, I really like crime thrillers. Do you prefer reading digital or traditional books? You know, it depends, really. If I'm travelling to college or on holiday, I like to read e-books, as they're on my tablet, and then I don't have to carry a book with me. But if I'm at home, I prefer a real book. How often do you go to the cinema? I don't go as often as I would like. There isn't a cinema near my house and I have to go into town if I want to see a film. So, I probably go once a month or even once every two months. Would you prefer to spend an evening reading a book or going to the cinema? I really enjoy going to the cinema and I try to see a film every month or two, but actually I also like lying on the sofa and reading a good book. It's much more exciting and relaxing than catching a train or a bus into town and going to the cinema, you know. Let's move on to talk about travelling. What form of transport do you use most often? I go to the college every day on the bus from my house. So, that's the one I use most often. The journey takes around half an hour and I have to catch two buses. Is there any type of transport that you don't like? I'm not fond of flying or of travelling on a ship. Being on a plane makes me feel quite anxious, actually, when you take off and land. I have only been on a ship once but I got quite seasick. What's the public transport system like in your country? In my city, it's very good. The buses are reliable and the trains always run on time. People don't mind leaving their cars at home. To go to work at the service is really good. Is there anything about travelling around your local area that you would change? I think they should create more cycle lines. More people would probably travel to work or to their college or university if the roads were safer for cyclists. At the moment, if you ride a bike, you have to share the road with cars and lorries, which isn't very safe.",193.0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxbGDCOkMh4,"Anna. Thank you so much.

Part 2 (student answering the 2nd part open question): 
Well, I have received lots of nice gifts in the past from my friends, you know, and from my relatives and family, but I think the one that comes to my mind most of all is something my sister gave me last year for my birthday. She always gives people something thoughtful, and for my birthday she made a photo album of my running achievements. On the inside page was a photo of the first race I've done. I think it was a 5 km run. My sister had also done this run, so the photo was of both of us at the end of the race, holding our medals. She used each page for different events or big achievements, and under each photo, she wrote a nice message. Some of the messages were really, really funny. The pages are thin black paper and she used white ink to write the messages, which makes the whole thing look lovely. It was one of the nicest presents I have ever received in my life. It shows how my running has become better over the past few years, and the photos are memories of some happy occasions. The album was only about half full when she gave it to me, so there are lots of pages left for future runs. Each time I do a special run, I add a photo and my sister writes a message next to it. There are lots of pages in the album and I think I will be adding photos to it for many more years. It was, you know, a really thoughtful gift and I am sure I will save it forever.
Part 3 (student and teacher's dialogue): 
We have been talking about the subject of presents, and I'd like to discuss this subject with you with some more general questions relating to this topic. First, do you think it's better to give rather than receive? It's always lovely to receive a present for somebody, but I think it's better to give. It's a great feeling to give someone something that really value. What types of gifts are particularly special for the person receiving them? I think it's always nice when someone gives something that the person has mentioned in the past. For example, if a friend or a relative is chatting with someone and you hear them say there is something they were thinking of buying or have always wanted, getting them that means you're listening to them and shows it's a thoughtful present. Is giving someone money for birthday presents more thoughtful than buying a gift? Sometimes it might be. There might be something they're saving up for and giving them some money towards. It could be better than buying them something they might not really want. Anyways, lots of people don't have enough money to spend a lot on the present but they can still get something that's valued. Are certain ages easier to buy presents for than others? Definitely yes. I have young nephews and nieces and it's always easier to choose something for them, but I find it quite difficult, you know, thinking of what to buy my older relatives. They always usually have the things they want. Why might it be good for a company to give a customer a free gift? I think it's important that a company shows customers they are appreciated. If they have been buying products or services from a company for a long time, giving the person a free gift shows them the company values their customer.

Let's talk about work. Have you ever worked before? Yes, I have worked, like, I'm currently studying and working at the same time, yeah, and I'm currently working as a web designer in a Korean company, and I also used to work before coming to Korea. Okay, what was your first day at work like? My first day at work was, I was firstly hired as an intern, and it was really fun and interesting, but there were some challenges with my technical duty, job duties, but I could go through it, and now it feels, like, more comfortable.

That is the end of part one.
Part 2 (student answering the 2nd part open question): 
Okay, so, as I said earlier, I work as a web designer and actually, the art is my, like, passion. And so, I would definitely want to have some painting in my house in the future. So, I think I would want to have some painting of nature with maybe horses in my home. Because I love horses and I also used to draw a lot in my childhood and I used to draw nature a lot. So, probably, I would love to have that on my house. And I'm not quite sure about the pricing, but I know paintings, like, cost quite expensive. So, it should probably cost me around $5,000 probably. That's my budget, like, for painting. And I would love to have it in my, like, office, like, in my home office. And so, when I work, I can look at it and sometimes, like, refresh my mind and get some inspiration to do some artwork, you know. And so, it's nice to, you know, have painting in your home because it also makes the decor, like, more beautiful and more cozy. Okay.
Part 3 (student and teacher's dialogue): 
So, let's talk more about some arts. How do people in your country feel about arts? Our art, I would say art is quite popular in my country. People love art and we also have a lot of museums with art installations, with different paintings. And people usually, you know, families go for art galleries on weekends. And most of them, art galleries and museums, they are actually, like, not that expensive. And most of them, the majority of them are free of charge. So, yeah, and I can say, yeah, overall I can say people love art in my country. That's great! And do you, would you say in your country people prefer music over arts? Well, it's a difficult question. I find it difficult to, like, get a correct answer. Probably it's, like, almost the same. I mean, they both like music and art. But if I have to choose one, I would say probably music, because, you know, it gives you some joy. It's maybe much more interesting and funnier. Okay, thank you. What are some traditional art forms in your country? Mostly it's paintings of, usually different portrait paintings is quite popular and also sculpture. And we have also a lot of ancient buildings that are decorated with handmade, like, artworks. Yeah. Okay, and how would you say art has changed over the past couple decades in your country? Well, a lot of, a lot of parts of art, I would say, have become digitalized a little bit in recent years because of, like, internet boom and all those technology side effects. And yeah, and it made it more convenient for people to explore art. But on the other hand, it's not as good as seeing it, you know, in busy or in real life. Yeah. All right. Let's move away from art in your country and talk a little bit about arts education. Do you think students should study arts in school? Yeah, I would say they should be taught art at school, because it's also important skill in our daily life, because art also helps people to think out of the box and express their feelings, maybe their vision in other way. Okay, thank you. And on top of that, how else do you think children could benefit from studying arts in school? I think, since I told it's another type of skill, art can help some children, you know, express their potentials or their skills, because not everyone is good at math or some natural sciences. Certainly, there are students that can be much better, do well on art subjects. So that's why it's important to have them. All right. Thank you. And do you think the government should provide support for arts during school time? Yeah, I would say yes, because since it's known, as far as I know, as art works and art people, then they tend to not make that much amount of money, and so they are definitely going to need some funding by the government. And in this way, I would say some kind of financial support should be provided for. Okay, thank you. That is the end of our IELTS speaking test.

Part 2 (student answering the 2nd part open question): 
This topic is talk about my... the book I read recently, and actually I don't really like to read books, but I read the book, Norwegian Woods. It is from the Japanese... his name is 春相春树, and I got this from my friend, and... I'm sorry. It's okay. It is talk about... it is a novel books, and the story is talk about a high school student. His friend was... died very early, and it is strange for him, and how it makes... makes him lifestyle, and how it forced his mind, and force his life, and it's like a little bit love story, and I like that book very much, and I spent, like, two months to read it because I am not so serious to read a book. I just, like, read it when I am boring, so I spend time on it when I have free time, yes. Okay, and what kinds of books do you usually read? I usually read, like, magazine, the fashion magazine, or the lifestyle, or the traveling magazine, because I like to get the information on the magazine.
Part 3 (student and teacher's dialogue): 
So, do you think people read more nowadays? No, I don't think people spend much time on books this generation, because the smartphone now is really... really easy to get it, and it's not really expensive now, the smartphone. And people spend much time on social media, or on YouTube, and some... on media now, so I think people spend less time on books. Definitely, they spend less time on books, but reading more social media, right? Their friend's stories, and all that stuff, right? How about yourself? Do you read before going to bed? Like, reading also social media, or online article, do you read before going to bed? Actually, I spend much time on phone now, and when I go on bed, my first thing is not to sleep, and it's for spending much time on cell phone, then I can fall asleep. If I don't use cell phone, I will read... and keep thinking about the other things, can fall asleep. Right. So, do you think that's a good habit, touching your smartphone before bed, just like this, all the time? Actually, not. I think that is not a good thing, because that will force my sleep. But, yes, that is a bad habit. That's okay, I mean, everyone has some habits that they don't like as well. Okay, now, in your opinion, how do you think e-books can affect paper books? Nowadays, people read from their smartphone or from their computer, and they have paper books. How do you think the invention of e-books will affect paper books? Yeah, I think e-books now is more convenient than books, because it's not too heavy, and you don't have to take much books on yourself. So, I think many students now use iPad to spend on studying, and that is more convenient, and you can use e-book or iPad. I'm sorry. That's okay. So you think it's easier, more convenient for e-books than having paper books. Carrying around many paper books, especially if you're a student, you have many books, e-books are much easier. Now let's talk about books and film. What's the difference you think between films and books? I think you can get information or what you want on film most faster. And if you like map, if you want to know the location, if you use the internet or use the phone, it's more faster than fighting on the book. Okay, what do you think, books are better or films are better? For example, the Harry Potter books and the Harry Potter movies, what do you think is better? I think sometimes the books will speak more, and the movies will... because they have the time for the movie, so it will be simpler than books. I think it all has the good sides of each other. Okay, very good. Thank you.

Part 2 (student answering the 2nd part open question): 
I think it is an environment problem. Air pollution is a serious problem. Usually, the beginning is in a China factory. They make too much, making a lot of things. So, I think the problem is being solved by the government. And international government's policy have to make them, such as reduce the time, making time. Or, the time has to be 10 or 12 in the days. Or, the making, the advertise to people. People have to think the air pollution is really serious. Then, they have to reduce the making and in factory. It has to be good to our in future. Or, the government has to say to people or to China. The air pollution cause is to them. They have to... your problem is hard to many countries. So, you have to stop or reduce your problems. Then... Okay, we'll just stop there.
Part 3 (student and teacher's dialogue): 
You've already talked about air pollution, ummm... what are some other problems in the environment in your country? Nowadays, the virus is an environmental problem, too. We already have the COVID virus, it's a really serious problem in international. We have to try to solve this problem, and we have to be careful. Another virus is for our and all future. So, how can we be careful about other viruses? Maybe wash hands and take a, wear a mask, or taking a feels, and be honest to my ways. That is, we have to try things. Okay, and how can people protect the environment? I think it's just a little thing, but don't throw the trash anywhere. We have to throw the trash, right things, and using the plastic to reduce, or ummm... try the vegetarian, or care of, care self, myself, like, my health, like, for my health, and talking with neighbor, and getting to the conversation about the environment problems. Okay, we have a lot of ways to protect the environment, like national parks. Do you think those things are a good way to help protect the environment? Um, before I say about this problem, solve the problem, it's just like little bit and hours. The national problem is we have to do big event, to making the big event for environment problems, um, making a day, about the three days, or planet day, then that day, we have to try for environment problems. We making a new, solve, new solve things, and then, we'll try to the problems. Okay, and these days, the problem of water pollution is becoming greater. What do you think we can do to help that problem? Firstly, we have to, we don't have to throw that trash to water, and we have to protect water animals and fish, and making a new scientist stuff, and to solve the water problems. Okay.

And some of the local neighbours plant flowers there every year. Right, and what can people do there? Actually, it's a small park, so there's not much to do there. It's just for looking pretty. You can go there, sit on the benches and watch the water in the fountain. And you can enjoy the beauty of the flowers, it's so enjoyable. And also, there's... it's right next to the bus stop, so you can wait for the bus there, too. Right, and do you enjoy spending time there? Yes, it's very enjoyable, and I like to go to the park, especially when the weather is nice. Because after being inside all day at work, I like to go to the park on my way home, because it's a way for spending time outside. And sometimes I run into my friends in the park, and I've gotten to know some of my neighbours and by spending time in the park. So that's an advantage. All right, and let's move on to talk about computers now. How much time do you spend using a computer? I spend several hours every day using a computer, because it's an important part of my job. I try to stay away from the computer on weekends, but I think I'm not that much successful at that, because there are always a lot of things that I want to do with it. So I think I spend a lot of time on computer, because somehow it is somehow addictive. Right, and do you use a computer for work, study or personal reasons? The reason why I spend a lot of time on the computer is that I use it for my work. I use it for my work and that most of my work involves creating documents for the company. So apart from that, I spend a lot of time playing computer games, because it makes me feel relaxed. And it's relaxing, especially when I'm working on a big project. Apart from that, I do some personal things on my computer. So the main reason I use the computer is for my work, but it's an important part of my personal life. OK, and what are some things that you don't like about using computers? Actually, nobody can deny that computers are useful and they make the things more convenient. For example, I couldn't do my job without the computer and it is very important in my life. But the thing is that, as I said, computers are a little bit addictive. For example, sometimes I spend a lot of time, I end up using the computer an entire afternoon, an entire Saturday afternoon instead of spending time with my friends, family or relatives or going outside or doing exercise.

Part 2 (student answering the 2nd part open question): 
When I was in the school, my favorite subject was history. I really liked it and I liked all kinds of history, and I still do. I started it every year in high school from 12th... from 9th through 12th. So, I learned a lot of new things about the history of our country. I learned about different events in the history of my country, and I learned about a lot of people, like, for example, inventors, like common people who contributed to our history, politicians, soldiers, etc. And I learned about all these things. I learned all these things about the history of other countries. So, I like history because it makes me understand, feel and imagine what history looked like in the past in different time. And it makes me understand that people have lived under different kinds of conditions during different kinds and different periods of the history. And they've had different kinds of, for example, interests, needs and emotions. So, I think it is very important to understand these kind of things.
Part 3 (student and teacher's dialogue): 
So, what school subjects were offered in the past that are not offered now? My parents told me that when they were in school, girls studied home economies and boys studied shop. Or, for example, girls learned how to cook and soup, and boys learned how to build and fix things. Now we don't have those, we don't have such those kind of subjects in school, and it seems very funny to me to spend time on those kind of things because I think they can learn them at home. And if you are interested in those subjects, actually, they are not academic things, academic subjects, and they are not things for school. Right, and what school subjects should be offered in the future that are not offered now, do you think? I think that's a very interesting question because we cannot predict the future, and the thing that is changing every day is technology. So, I think whatever schools teach should be related to the history, sorry, should be related to the technology of the future. For example, maybe students will learn at home by, they learn at home alone by using the computer or internet, or they will learn the same or similar subjects as we are learning now, but they will learn in a different way. For example, by using the internet or computer. Right, and do you think the main purpose of education is to accumulate knowledge or to prepare for a job? I think both things are important. For example, when you are younger, you need to learn basic skills. For example, you first, learn how to write, read, and use a computer, then you learn to think, analyze, and interpret. So, these are the skills that you need in all steps of your life, in all aspects of your life, especially for your future job. But then when you are a little bit older, for example, in high school or in college, you start focusing on the skills that you might need in the future for a specific type of job. So, I think both things are important. And that's it. Okay, and how important is it to have an educated society? I think it is very important to have an educated society because if some of the people are highly educated and others are poorly educated, so there is not an equal participation in the society because those who are highly educated are more likely to have more money and more political power than those who are less educated. So, if you want to have an equal society, there should be everyone should be prepared and should be equally educated. I know that it is ideal, but it's something to work for.

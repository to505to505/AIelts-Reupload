Using inappropriate adjectives: For instance, avoid using ""historic"" to describe a modern city unless you refer to a specific historical part of it.
Misuse of idioms: Make sure you understand the idioms before using them. For example, ""off the beaten track"" is not the same as ""remote"" and should be used in the context of finding less popular, yet interesting, places.
Overgeneralization: Instead of saying, ""It's a nice place,"" try to be more specific, like ""It’s a charming, historic town with picturesque streets."""

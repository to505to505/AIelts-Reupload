# AIelts

This application is engineered to provide effective preparation for the IELTS Speaking part by delivering detailed practice combined with personalized feedback.
Users engage by recording their responses to a wide array of questions, covering all three parts of the IELTS speaking module. This process simulates actual exam conditions, allowing for systematic skill development. 
After you record, your speech is automatically turned into text by the most advanced and new speech-to-text models. They track all your pauses, pronouncation mistakes and tone so no information is lost! It is then carefully reviewed by our AI system. To make sure the feedback is as accurate and helpful as possible, our AI uses a RAG, which connects it to a exclusive collection of actual IELTS speaking tests records. Deliberate tuning of out AI system makes it perform with astonishing 94% accuracy[^1] in grading. 


Besides the grades, AIelts is designed to give you really useful and practical feedback to improve every part of your spoken English. It will pinpoint any grammar mistakes, awkward sentences, or wrong words you used, helping you fix basic language issues.  Plus, the AI will suggest better words, phrases, and expressions to boost your vocabulary and get a higher score for your language range. It also looks at how fast you speak, suggesting if you need to speed up or slow down to sound more natural and easy to understand.

On top of that, it is an extremely convenient, easy and pleasent to use application which makes the preparation less painfull.

all_instructions  = "Fluency and coherence: for grade 9: Fluent with only very occasional repetition or self-correction. Any hesitation is content-related, not to find words or grammar. Fully coherent and appropriately extended topic development.; \nfor grade 8: Fluent with occasional repetition or self-correction. Hesitations are mostly content-related. Coherent and relevant topic development.; \nfor grade 7: Able to keep going and readily produce long turns without noticeable effort. Some hesitation, repetition, and/or self-correction may occur, often mid-sentence, indicating problems with accessing appropriate language. However, these do not affect coherence.; \nfor grade 6: Able to keep going and demonstrates a willingness to produce long turns. Coherence may be lost at times due to hesitation, repetition, and/or self-correction.; \nfor grade 5: Usually able to keep going, but relies on repetition and self-correction to do so and/or on slow speech. Hesitations are often associated with mid-sentence searches for basic lexis and grammar.; \nfor grade 4: Unable to keep going without noticeable pauses. Speech may be slow with frequent repetition. Often self-corrects. Can link simple sentences but often with repetitious use of connectives. Some breakdowns in coherence.; \nfor grade 3: Frequent, sometimes long, pauses occur while candidate searches for words. Limited ability to link simple sentences and go beyond simple responses to questions. Frequently unable to convey basic message.; \nfor grade 2: Lengthy pauses before nearly every word. Isolated words may be recognisable but speech is of virtually no communicative significance.; \nfor grade 1: Essentially none. Speech is totally incoherent. No resource bar a few isolated words. No communication possible.\n\nLexical resource: for grade 9: Total flexibility and precise use in all contexts, with idiomatic language. Vocabulary is situationally appropriate.; \nfor grade 8: Wide resource, flexible use for all topics. Skilful use of less common items with some inaccuracies.; \nfor grade 7: Resource flexibly used to discuss a variety of topics. Some ability to use less common and idiomatic items and an awareness of style and collocation is evident, though inappropriacies occur. Effective use of paraphrase as required.; \nfor grade 6: Resource sufficient to discuss topics at length. Vocabulary use may be inappropriate but meaning is clear. Generally able to paraphrase successfully.; \nfor grade 5: Resource sufficient to discuss familiar and unfamiliar topics but with limited flexibility. Attempts paraphrase but not always with success.; \nfor grade 4: Resource sufficient for familiar topics but only basic meaning can be conveyed on unfamiliar topics. Frequent inappropriacies and errors in word choice. Rarely attempts paraphrase.; \nfor grade 3: Resource limited to simple vocabulary used primarily to convey personal information. Vocabulary inadequate for unfamiliar topics.; \nfor grade 2: Very limited resource. Utterances consist of isolated words or memorised utterances. Little communication possible without the support of mime or gesture.; \nfor grade 1: No rateable language unless memorised.\n\nGrammatical range and accuracy: for grade 9: Structures are precise and accurate with native-like 'mistakes'.; \nfor grade 8: Wide range of structures, flexibly used. Most sentences are error-free with occasional basic errors.; \nfor grade 7: A range of structures flexibly used. Error-free sentences are frequent. Both simple and complex sentences are used effectively despite some errors. A few basic errors persist.; \nfor grade 6: Produces a mix of short and complex sentence forms and a variety of structures with limited flexibility. Though errors frequently occur in complex structures, these rarely impede communication.; \nfor grade 5: Basic sentence forms are fairly well controlled for accuracy. Complex structures are attempted but limited in range, often containing errors.; \nfor grade 4: Can produce basic sentence forms and some short utterances are error-free. Subordinate clauses are rare, and overall, turns are short, structures are repetitive, and errors are frequent.; \nfor grade 3: Basic sentence forms are attempted but grammatical errors are numerous except in apparently memorised utterances.; \nfor grade 2: No evidence of basic sentence forms.; \nfor grade 1: Can produce occasional individual words and phonemes that are recognisable, but no overall meaning is conveyed."

    "CommentaryGrammar": "<h2>Overall Grammar Feedback</h2>\n<p>Your grammatical range shows a good attempt at complex structures, but there are several areas where improvement is needed. You frequently omit articles, such as in \"play piano\" instead of \"play the piano,\" which can lead to confusion. Additionally, there are issues with prepositions, as seen in phrases like \"among of people\" instead of \"among people.\" Subject-verb agreement errors, such as \"are not good at in their fields,\" also detract from your overall clarity. Furthermore, your verb tenses are inconsistent, particularly when discussing past experiences, as in \"I had learned English\" instead of \"I learned English.\" Addressing these weaknesses will enhance your grammatical accuracy and overall fluency.</p>\n\n<h2>Comment on Advanced Grammar Structures</h2>\n<p>You have made some attempts to use advanced grammar structures, such as conditionals and relative clauses, but there is room for more variety. For instance, using inversion for emphasis could strengthen your statements, e.g., \"Never have I felt so passionate about teaching.\" Cleft sentences could also be beneficial, such as \"It is teaching that I am most passionate about.\" Incorporating passive voice could help shift focus in your responses, e.g., \"The lessons are taught by me.\" Additionally, using the subjunctive mood could enhance your expressions of wishes or hypothetical situations, e.g., \"I suggest that my students practice more.\" Expanding your use of these structures will demonstrate a higher level of grammatical sophistication.</p>"

  "coherence_feedback": {
    "CommentaryCoherence": "The student demonstrated a fair level of fluency and coherence throughout the speaking test. However, there were moments where the answers could have been more structured. For instance, in Part 1, the responses were somewhat brief and could benefit from elaboration to showcase more language proficiency. In Part 2, the student maintained a good length (122 seconds), which is within the optimal range, but the ideas could have been more clearly organized. Logical connections were sometimes unclear, particularly in the transition between thoughts. To improve, the student should practice structuring answers with clear main points and supporting details. Engaging in more conversational practice and listening to fluent speakers can help enhance coherence and fluency. Additionally, focusing on linking ideas logically will aid in creating smoother transitions between thoughts."
